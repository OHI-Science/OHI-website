      <description>About the OHI Fellows Program The Ocean Health Index Global Fellowship was created to provide training to a small group of early-career data scientists.&#xA;During the process of calculating OHI scores, the fellows dive into the theory, tools, and workflows the OHI uses to ensure openness, transparency, and reproducibility. The Fellows gain valuable experience and build useful skills.&#xA;We benefit from their fresh eyes and new perspectives. Their contributions help the OHI grow and innovate.</description>
