1,"land: Two sets of variables are available for download. One consists of 33 biologically relevant variables, including seasonal and annual means, extremes, growing and chilling degree days, snow fall, potential evapotranspiration, and a number of drought indices. The second dataset consists of 48 monthly temperature and precipitation variables. See the metadata for complete description of variables.","CMIP6: SSP1_2.6, SSP2_4.5, SSP3_7.0, SSP5_8.5",yearly and monthly variables averaged for 20 or 30 year periods,"The ensemble mean projections are calculated from the 8-model ensemble and a larger 13-model ensemble (see dendrogram below), the latter being representative of the full unconstrained CMIP6 ensemble (Mahony et al. 2022). Consistent with the guidance provided by Hausfather et al. (2022), users wishing to use an ensemble mean projection are encouraged to use the 8-model rather than the 13-model ensemble mean.","Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection, at 1km resolution",These are derived from Mahoney et al. 2022
2,"land: humidity, precipitation, min/max air temp, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed","CMIP5: RCP4.5, RCP8.5",monthly and daily,20 climate models provided (no ensemble),~4 or 6km,"can obtain and combine climate models using R packages climate futures toolbox (CFT) (https://github.com/earthlab/cft), or climateR (https://mikejohnson51.github.io/climateR-intro/#123)"
