Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;Mariculture was calculated as the yield reported multiplied by the sustainability for each species harvested. Yield was drawn from UN FAO reports, and sustainability was based on information from a Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) by Trujillo (2008).;The reference point for mariculture was a spatial comparison set at highest amount of seafood produced per square kilometer of eligible coastline in the most productive region observed, China.;Restricting the area based on biophysical constraints and social preferences at a global scale was not possible, and so the entire area within 3nm of the coastline was considered potential habitat.
Global 2013 - 2015;This study used a model similar to the Global 2012.;The reference point approach was harvested tonnes per coastal inhabitant scaled to the 95th percentile observed, Thailand. Here coastal was defined as “within 25 km inland.” This was done under the assumption that production depends on the presence of coastal communities.;This study differs from Global 2012 because of the reference point.
Brazil 2014;The status was calculated using harvest data reported by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). For each of up to four species cultured within the state, the score was determined by the yield, the reference sustainable production per unit area, and the total potential farming area.;Reference points were set for each species.;In this study it was possible to use both biophysical constraints and social preferences.
U.S. West Coast 2014;The status was calculated as the sustainable production density of shellfish biomass from mariculture relative to a target level of production density for each state within the region.;The reference point was a target level of production increase as proposed by NOAA.;The approach was similar to the Global but the reference point was made using better information about physical and social limitations on mariculture allotments.
Israel 2014;The status of the Mariculture sub-goal was calculated as the sustainable production of finfish biomass from mariculture relative to a target level of production for Israel.;The official target yield by the year 2020 (8,500 tons of finfish).;Species considered in the analysis were limited to one (Sparus aurata), because this species comprises nearly all (an estimated 99%) of the current mariculture production of seafood in Israel. Mariculture is regulated centrally for the whole of Israel and is currently legally carried out in specific areas of the Southern region. As such, the score for South was applied to all other regions.
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;Two relevant species were assessed: shrimp and tilapia. Status was calculated as an average of the two species’ production in four recent years. This value is multiplied by a sustainability index for mariculture locally, and divided by the number of inhabitants in the coastal zone for each region.;A spatial reference point was used here, ie. region with the highest production.;N/A
China 2015;Status model is similar to the 2012 global assessment. But the status model was based on tonnes of mariculture species per habitat identified as suitable area by the Chinese government.;The spatial reference point was the region with the highest value.;Using designated mariculture area for calculations provides a more realistic picture of the status of mariculture. Currently Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) values were obtained from the global study. More data on water quality standards and food sources (eg. species, origin, etc) will help determine the sustainability of mariculture.
