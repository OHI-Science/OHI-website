      <description>AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL FOOD SOURCE This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught fisheries.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that most regions are significantly below their sustainable target values. Many regions are jeopardizing future catch by overharvesting, whereas a few are not catching as much wild-caught seafood as they could.&#xA;The global score has, on average, dropped nearly one fifthteenth of a point every year since 2012. This modest decline is due mainly to the decreasing sustainability of some fisheries, which means many stocks are being overfished.</description>

      <description>AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize the production of farm-raised marine food.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that most regions are not sustainably producing as much farmed seafood as they could. A small number of countries are responsible for almost all global mariculture production. In fact, in 2020 China produced a staggering 67% of global mariculture production.&#xA;Even though mariculture has been one of the fastest growing food sectors in the world over the past 20 years (FAO 2020) global mariculture scores have only seen a slight increase since 2012.</description>
