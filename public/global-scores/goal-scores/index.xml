      <description>ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that many regions are addressing and meeting the needs that people and communities have to fish artisanally by implementing government policies that permit or encourage them to do so and providing appropriate access to near-shore areas.</description>

      <title>Goal: Carbon Storage</title>

      <description>PRESERVING HABITATS THAT ABSORB CARBON This goal captures the ability of coastal habitats to store carbon given the amount of carbon they store and their health.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates there has been a global decline in the assessed carbon storing habitats since 1980: mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and tidal flats.&#xA;The relatively high score for this goal suggest these habitats, despite declines, are relatively healthy and intact in many countries.</description>

      <description>CLEAN WATERS ARE IMPORTANT The Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that there are large opportunities for improvement. The reduction of chemicals, nutrients, human and animal wastes and trash requires will require action at every level of society as well as adjustments to behavior on an individual basis.&#xA;Overall, the Clean Waters goal has modestly improved since 2012.</description>

      <title>Goal: Coastal Protection</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-scores/goal-scores/coastal-protection/</link>

      <description>PRESERVING HABITATS THAT SAFEGUARD SHORES This goal aims to assess the protection that coastal habitats provide against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.).&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that although, in many places, these habitats (mangroves, salt marshes, coastal sea ice, coral reefs, and seagrasses) remain healthy and intact, their condition has degraded in comparison to about thirty years ago.</description>

      <title>Goal: Natural Products</title>

      <description>HARVESTING OCEAN RESOURCES SUSTAINABLY This goal assesses how well countries are maximizing the sustainable harvest of non-food marine resources.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE The current score indicates that many regions have potential to improve sustainable harvests of natural products, either by eliminating overharvesting, increasing harvests that are too low, or reducing the pressures that decrease potential harvests.&#xA;Despite the relatively good global score, trends in Natural Products are decreasing. This decline is likely due to the decreasing sustainability of forage fisheries, which largely drive the Natural Products scores due to the large amount of harvest compared to seaweeds and ornamental fish in many regions.</description>

      <description>THE DRAW OF THE OCEAN Coastal and marine tourism is a vital part of a country’s economy. This goal measures participation in sustainable tourism to coastal regions.&#xA;CURRENT SCORE This year&amp;rsquo;s analysis provided insight into the pandemic’s impact on global tourism.&#xA;This year, the data we used to for tourism sustainability was from the from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) new Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI).</description>
