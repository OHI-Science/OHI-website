      <description>2024 Ocean Health Index Scores! by Sophia Lecuona, Anna Ramji, Dustin Duncan, Melanie Frazier, Ben Halpern&#xA;Tue, Dec 03, 2024&#xA;This year marked the largest decline in global Ocean Health Index scores we have observed over 13 years of assessments.&#xA;The global Ocean Health Index (OHI, for short) measures how well we are managing the marine resources we depend upon and enjoy. We measure 10 benefits, or goals, that people want and need from the ocean for 220 coastal countries and territories.</description>

      <description>The Trouble with Transformation The Challenges of Projecting Spatial Data by Anna Ramji&#xA;Fri, Sep 13, 2024&#xA;Introduction Have you ever wondered what happens to your mapped raster data when you project it from one Coordinate Reference System (CRS) to another? Or whether anything can go wrong when projecting?&#xA;In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how reprojecting and transforming geospatial data can potentially lead to large errors! To help you avoid this problem we&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to check for and avoid these problems.</description>

      <description>Ensuring Accuracy in Spatial Analysis A Mesophotic Dive into Coordinate Reference Systems by Dustin Duncan&#xA;Fri, Aug 30, 2024&#xA;What is a Coordinate Reference System? Coordinate reference systems can refer to either geographic coordinate systems or projected coordinate systems. Geographic coordinate systems describe locations on earth using a three-dimensional reference, and are used along with a specified map projection to create a projected coordinate system, which describes the same information on a two-dimensional surface (1) .</description>

      <description>The Lasting Special Places Sub-goal: Protected Areas and their Environmental Impacts by Erika Egg&#xA;Fri, Sep 15, 2023&#xA;The Ocean Health Index&amp;rsquo;s (OHI) Lasting Special Places (LSP) sub-goal within the Sense of Place goal aims to quantify “how well we are protecting the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity” (OHI, n.d., para. 1). We look at that in terms of meeting a threshold of protection: 30% of coastal area protected for a given OHI region translates to a score of 100 for this sub-goal, with coastal area defined as the combined area 3 nautical miles (nm) offshore and 1 kilometer (km) inland along the OHI region’s coast.</description>

      <description>Waves of Controversy The Faroe Islands&#39; Whale Hunt and its Ripple Effect on Ocean Health Index Scores by Carlo Broderick&#xA;Fri, Sep 01, 2023&#xA;The practice of whale hunting has been a long-standing tradition in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark (Olsen 2011). However, this cultural practice has recently come under increased domestic and international scrutiny. In September 2021, an unusually large whale hunt drew widespread attention and criticism.</description>

      <description>Understanding the journey from raw data to goal scores in OHI by Adelaide Robinson&#xA;Wed, Aug 23, 2023&#xA;The Ocean Health Index monitors 10 key goals for ensuring the ocean is able to sustainably meet the needs of people around the world. In order to monitor ocean health at a comprehensive scale, the OHI team has to process and incorporate many different datasets. But how exactly do we get from raw data to calculating goal scores?</description>

      <description>CMIP6 Climate Scenario data: Where do I get the data! by Melanie Frazier, Ben Halpern, Alejandra Vargas, Mandy Lombard&#xA;Fri, Dec 16, 2022&#xA;If you are an ecologist or biologist and need predictions of future climate variables, then the CMIP6 Scenario data will probably be what you want!&#xA;In this blogpost, we provide an overview of the raw CMIP6 data because this is helpful for understanding these data. However, because we believe non-climate scientists should probably seek more derived CMIP6 products, we also provide information about some of these products that we have used in our research.</description>

The following post will walk through an R script we wrote to scrape download links from a webpage, download the PDFs found at those links, and then extract data from the downloaded documents.</description>

      <description>Adding tidal flat ecosystems to OHI by Cullen Molitor&#xA;Thu, Sep 01, 2022&#xA;The Ocean Health Index has decided to update the habitat subgoal of biodiversity by adding tidal flat ecosystems to complement the existing habitat types (seagrass, kelp, coral reefs, mangroves, salt marsh, sea ice edge, and soft bottom). Tidal flat habitat is defined as sand, rock, or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation. This vital habitat is distributed globally, but up until this recently there was very limited data on the extent of these ecosystems, especially at the global scale.</description>

      <description>Switching from the raster package to terra for spatial analysis by Juliet Cohen&#xA;Thu, Aug 25, 2022&#xA;Spatial data in R has a reputation for being tedious and time consuming. With so many different spatial file types (.shp, .nc, .gpkg, .geojson, and .tif to name a few) with various resolutions and coordinate reference systems, it can be challenging to produce accurate maps. Most data scientists have historically utilized the raster package to calculate cell values across stacked layers and recognize patterns over space and time.</description>

      <description>Building Transparency and Trust for Healthy New England Seas Using the Ocean Health Index by Jenny Seifert&#xA;Mon, Nov 04, 2019&#xA;In a world of increasingly complex decision making, transparency has become paramount. This is no exception in science and, specifically, in science-based management of natural resources.&#xA;Transparency is at the core of the Ocean Health Index (OHI). As a scientific evaluation of ocean health designed to inform management decisions that affect not just oceans but also people, it comes with the responsibility of transparency.</description>

      <description>Three Lessons for Using the Global Ocean Health Index to Assess Local Oceans by Jenny Seifert&#xA;Fri, Apr 26, 2019&#xA;Cross-posted at NCEAS&#xA;It just made sense. That was a theme I drew from conversations with four people involved in separate efforts to use the Ocean Health Index’s global framework to zoom in on ocean health in their particular regions to support local ocean planning.&#xA;The Index was designed to be useful to ocean planning around the world, and to be useful, it must be applicable to place-based management, which is how so many decisions that affect ocean health are made after all.</description>
