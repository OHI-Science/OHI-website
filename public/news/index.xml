      <description>Waves of Controversy The Faroe Islands&#39; Whale Hunt and its Ripple Effect on Ocean Health Index Scores by Carlo Broderick
Fri, Sep 01, 2023
The practice of whale hunting has been a long-standing tradition in the Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark (Olsen 2011). However, this cultural practice has recently come under increased domestic and international scrutiny. In September 2021, an unusually large whale hunt drew widespread attention and criticism.</description>

      <description>Understanding the journey from raw data to goal scores in OHI by Adelaide Robinson
Wed, Aug 23, 2023
The Ocean Health Index monitors 10 key goals for ensuring the ocean is able to sustainably meet the needs of people around the world. In order to monitor ocean health at a comprehensive scale, the OHI team has to process and incorporate many different datasets. But how exactly do we get from raw data to calculating goal scores?</description>

      <description>Getting to know the 2023 Fellows by Carlo Broderick, Adelaide Robinson, Erika Egg
Mon, May 29, 2023
In 2023, the Ocean Health Index Global Fellows program has welcomed three fresh Data Science and Communication Fellows to its ranks. The selected trio all hail from the newly instituted Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program. This course is a collaborative effort between the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).</description>

      <description>CMIP6 Climate Scenario data: Where do I get the data! by Melanie Frazier, Ben Halpern, Alejandra Vargas, Mandy Lombard
Fri, Dec 16, 2022
If you are an ecologist or biologist and need predictions of future climate variables, then the CMIP6 Scenario data will probably be what you want!
In this blogpost, we provide an overview of the raw CMIP6 data because this is helpful for understanding these data. However, because we believe non-climate scientists should probably seek more derived CMIP6 products, we also provide information about some of these products that we have used in our research.</description>

      <description>11 years of OHI Scores! by The OHI Team
Tue, Dec 06, 2022
We are proud to announce our 11th (!) year of measuring the state of the world’s oceans.
The global Ocean Health Index (OHI, for short) measures how well we are managing the sustainable delivery of 10 benefits, or goals, that people want and need from the ocean.
As usual, the 2022 assessment includes a new year of data, calculated using the most recent data available from agencies and other sources.</description>

      <description>Scraping Webpages and PDF&amp;rsquo;s in R with rvest and tabulizer by Peter Menzies
Wed, Sep 07, 2022
Overview Sometimes the data we need aren&amp;rsquo;t readily accessible — this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be news to any of us who regularly work with and seek out datasets. The following post will walk through an R script we wrote to scrape download links from a webpage, download the PDFs found at those links, and then extract data from the downloaded documents.</description>

      <title>Introducing Tidal Flat Habitat</title>

      <description>Adding tidal flat ecosystems to OHI by Cullen Molitor
Thu, Sep 01, 2022
The Ocean Health Index has decided to update the habitat subgoal of biodiversity by adding tidal flat ecosystems to complement the existing habitat types (seagrass, kelp, coral reefs, mangroves, salt marsh, sea ice edge, and soft bottom). Tidal flat habitat is defined as sand, rock, or mud flats that undergo regular tidal inundation. This vital habitat is distributed globally, but up until this recently there was very limited data on the extent of these ecosystems, especially at the global scale.</description>

      <description>Switching from the raster package to terra for spatial analysis by Juliet Cohen
Thu, Aug 25, 2022
Spatial data in R has a reputation for being tedious and time consuming. With so many different spatial file types (.shp, .nc, .gpkg, .geojson, and .tif to name a few) with various resolutions and coordinate reference systems, it can be challenging to produce accurate maps. Most data scientists have historically utilized the raster package to calculate cell values across stacked layers and recognize patterns over space and time.</description>

Fri, Jan 28, 2022
If you are an ecologist or biologist and need data predicting future climate, then CMIP6 Scenario data may be what you are searching for! But, these data are big and complicated, and it can take some effort to understand them, especially if you are not a climate scientist.</description>

Mon, Sep 21, 2020
The new assessment tool, the Baltic Health Index (BHI) evaluates comprehensively the health status of the Baltic Sea and has been calculated by researchers at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University, in cooperation with scientists in California who have established the well-known global Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework. The Ocean Health Index provides comprehensive, and quantitative assessments of progress towards healthy and sustainable oceans.</description>

      <description>Building Transparency and Trust for Healthy New England Seas Using the Ocean Health Index by Jenny Seifert
Mon, Nov 04, 2019
In a world of increasingly complex decision making, transparency has become paramount. This is no exception in science and, specifically, in science-based management of natural resources.
Transparency is at the core of the Ocean Health Index (OHI). As a scientific evaluation of ocean health designed to inform management decisions that affect not just oceans but also people, it comes with the responsibility of transparency.</description>

      <description>Three Lessons for Using the Global Ocean Health Index to Assess Local Oceans by Jenny Seifert
Fri, Apr 26, 2019
Cross-posted at NCEAS
It just made sense. That was a theme I drew from conversations with four people involved in separate efforts to use the Ocean Health Index’s global framework to zoom in on ocean health in their particular regions to support local ocean planning.
The Index was designed to be useful to ocean planning around the world, and to be useful, it must be applicable to place-based management, which is how so many decisions that affect ocean health are made after all.</description>
