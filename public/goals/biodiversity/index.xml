      <description>PRESERVING MARINE HABITATS This goal measures the status of marine habitats that support large numbers of marine species.&#xA;GOAL DESCRIPTION Healthier habitats mean healthier species! Habitat is included as a subgoal of the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system than only considering the conservation status of species (the other subgoal for Biodiversity). This is because species assessments are often incomplete.&#xA;This goal assesses the condition of marine habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species.</description>

      <description>PRESERVING MARINE SPECIES This goal measures the conservation status of marine species.&#xA;GOAL DESCRIPTION The species that inhabit the ocean have a vital role in shaping the existing marine environment. They are valued for their beauty and inherent right to exist, as well as their role in supporting productive habitats that provide many benefits for people.&#xA;From the largest predators to microscopic plankton, these species depend upon each other for survival.</description>
