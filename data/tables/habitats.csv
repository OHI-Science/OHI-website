Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was assessed for all habitats for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice edge, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats. Status was assessed as the average of the condition estimates for each habitat present in a region.;The reference years were between 1980-1995 and the current years were between 2001-2010. The current condition was compared 1980 for salt marshes and sand dunes, and it varied by site for seagrasses.;Anomalous values occurred due to data availability issues. A significant amount of pre-processing of the habitat data was needed to fill data gaps and resolve data quality issue.
Global 2013 - 2015;The goal model was the same as 2012.;The reference was the same as Global 2013.;The same model as 2012 was used.
Brazil 2014;The goal model was the same as as Global 2012 for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats.;The timeframes between current and reference condition varied across habitats using a 20-year gap.;Information from a few point estimates had to be used to infer the health of many habitats.
U.S. West Coast 2014;Salt marshes and seagrass beds were considered. Extent was used and habitat health was not used.;Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage. For sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s.;The study required reconstructions of historic habitat extents in order to set more ambitious targets.
Israel 2014;The goal model is the same as Global 2012 for two habitats: sand dunes and soft-bottom habitats.;Reliable, comprehensive satellite photos from 1970 enabled an evaluation of the habitat extent of the sand dunes as its reference point. For soft-bottom habitat we utilized relevant pressure as a proxy of habitat conditions.;These habitats were chosen because they represent a large portion of regional coastal and marine environments and because they have data with relatively comprehensive temporal and spatial coverage. Other important habitats such as rocky reefs and the rocky intertidal could not be included due to lack of data on current and/or past spatial extent and condition.
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach is the same as Global 2012. Two types of habitats are considered: soft bottoms and mangroves.;For soft bottoms, the reference point was when is no deterioration of habitat due to the effects of trawling in the area. The reference point for mangroves was its extent in 1991.;N/A
China 2015;See Global 2012.;A temporal reference point for each habitat is set to its condition in 1980’s.;Three types of habitats were assessed: seagrasses, saltmarsh, and mangroves. Not all habitat exist in all provinces and time-series data of extent is poor for some. Time-series data on the condition of each habitat is not obtainable. However, rough estimate of relative change in coverage areas since the 1980’s was found in literature.
