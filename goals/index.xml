      <description>HARVESTING OCEAN RESOURCES SUSTAINABLY This goal assesses how well countries are maximizing the sustainable harvest of non-food marine resources.
 GOAL DESCRIPTION Marine natural products can provide substantial economic benefits when sustainably harvested and traded. For example, millions of marine ornamental (aquarium) fish are harvested and exported for sale each year. This trade can provide a valuable and long-term income stream for low-income coastal communities if undertaken in sustainable manner.</description>

      <description>PRESERVING HABITATS THAT ABSORB CARBON This goal captures the ability of coastal habitats to store carbon given the amount of carbon they store and their health.
 GOAL DESCRIPTION Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the primary heat trapping gas in Earth’s atmosphere and is a key driver of global climate change. The ocean plays a major role in slowing the pace of global climate change by absorbing CO₂ from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon.</description>

      <description>PRESERVING HABITATS THAT SAFEGUARD SHORES This goal aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.).
 GOAL DESCRIPTION Storm protection by coastal habitats saves lives, property and is worth billions of dollars each year. Coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice act as natural buffers against incoming waves.</description>

      <description>THE DRAW OF THE OCEAN Coastal and marine tourism is a vital part of a country’s economy. This goal measures participation in sustainable tourism to coastal regions.
 GOAL DESCRIPTION Tourism and recreation in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems. Tourism and recreation provide opportunities for the enjoyment of marine and coastal environments. The ability to visit culturally or aesthetically pleasing places with healthy coastal ecosystems, diverse wildlife, and opportunities for exploration and recreation contributes to the well-being of many people.</description>

      <description>CLEAN WATERS ARE IMPORTANT The Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes.
 GOAL DESCRIPTION The Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes. People value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons.
Contamination of waters from chemicals, eutrophication, pathogens, and trash enter the marine environment in a number of ways.</description>
