The underlying philosophy behind the Index is that a healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future.

For the global study, participating scientists, economists, and sociologists reviewed existing studies of what people want and expect from the ocean and then grouped them into ten categories called ‘goals.’  

Each goal is scored based on the delivery of specific benefits with respect to a sustainable target. A goal is given a score of 100 if its benefits are maximized without compromising the ocean’s ability to deliver those benefits in the future.  Lower scores indicate that more benefits could be gained or that current methods are harming the delivery of future benefits.

The following provides a *very* brief overview of how we calculate *Goal Scores*, *Country Index Scores*, and *Global Index Scores*. For more information, take a look at the resources provided at the bottom of this page. 

### GOAL SCORES

*Goal Scores* are based on several components: current status, likely future status, trend, pressures, and resilience.  

To calculate each *Goal Score* we average the *Present Status* and *Likely Future Status*: 

**CURRENT STATUS** is a goal’s current value compared to its reference point, resulting in a score from 0 to 100. 

**LIKELY FUTURE STATUS** is the predicted status score five years into the future (once again, on a scale from 0 to 100), which is estimated by adjusting the current status score by 3 variables: 

1. **TREND** which is the change in a goal’s status observed over the most recent five years. 
2. **PRESSURES** which are the ecological and social factors that decrease a goal's status. 
3. **RESILIENCE** which are ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc) that mitigate the pressures acting on a goal.

### REGION INDEX SCORES
A region's *Index Score* is the average of its goal scores. Goal scores are weighted equally in global assessments, but independent assessments could weight them differently depending on local conditions and values.   

### GLOBAL GOAL AND INDEX SCORES
The *Global Score* is the average of scores for all assessed regions weighted by EEZ area.
