A healthy ocean sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future.

For the global study, participating scientists, economists and sociologists reviewed existing studies of what people want and expect from the ocean, then grouped them into ten categories called ‘goals.’  

Each goal is scored based on the delivery of specific benefits with respect to a sustainable target. A goal is given a score of 100 if its maximum sustainable benefits are gained in ways that do not compromise the ocean’s ability to deliver those benefits in the future.  Lower scores indicate that more benefits could be gained or that current methods are harming the delivery of future benefits.


### GOAL SCORES

The GOAL SCORE is the average of the scores for Present Status and Likely Future Status. 

**CURRENT STATUS** is a goal’s current value compared to its reference point. 

**LIKELY FUTURE STATUS** is the predicted status score five years into the future, which is estimated by adjusting current status scores by 3 variables: 

* **TREND** is the observed change of a goal’s status over the most recent five years. 
* **PRESSURES** are the ecological and social factors that decrease a goal's status. 
* **RESILIENCE** are ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc) that mitigate the pressures acting on a goal.

### REGION INDEX SCORES
A region's index score is the average of its goal scores. Goal scores are weighted equally in global assessments, but independent assessments could weight them differently depending on local conditions and values.   

### GLOBAL GOAL AND INDEX SCORE
The global score is the average of scores for all assessed regions weighted by EEZ area.
