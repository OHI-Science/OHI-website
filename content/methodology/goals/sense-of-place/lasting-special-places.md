This sub-goal focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected.

> This sub-goal makes use of protected areas, and some of the same information gathered on projected areas can be used to create resilience data layers like Marine Protected Areas.

### Ideal Approach

Ideally, you would be able to survey everyone in your region and produce a list of all the places they consider special, and then assess how well they are protected relative to a desired state. How well they are protected could be the percentage of area protected, and you could also find how well they are protected using other data. This sub-goal could also be based on the extent to which people participate in spiritual or religious activities in an area.

### Practical Guidance

The ideal list of special places don’t exist in practice, and this is a difficult goal to express accurately, since it attempts to capture how people interact culturally with their coastal places. You can define “special” with specific criteria. A good example to look at is the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014) and Brazil Assessment (2014).

More likely, you would follow the global assessment and use lists of protected areas as catalogues of special places, and the area of designated protected places relative to a reference point (eg. of thirty percent coastal area protected) is used as a measure. Coastal area could be based off a 1 square km buffer inland, as in the Global Assessment, or it could be based on what is reasonable to your area. In any case, you would want to consider how far out from shore you should include as well; would it be 3 nautical miles, or as far as your territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles?

Data sources should be specific to your region. International databases, like the World Database of Protected Areas (www.protectedplanet.net/), offer rich information, but they may not be as up-to-date as the list of national parks in your area, and may not have as much information on the quality of protection. If you have more information on quality, you could think about another approach than the thirty percent reference point target.

Global assessment incorporated both marine and terrestrial protected areas. However, if only data on marine protected areas is available, you can calculate only the marine component of the goal. This is not ideal but OHI is flexible to work with the data available.

> If you assessment involves multiple categories (e.g., antiquities, MPAs, beaches of special interest), whether you group them together or calculate each category separately depends on reference points. Maybe you want 10% of offshore water to be in MPAs, but only 5% of coastlines to be beaches and 3% Antiquities, for example; in this case, you would calculate them separately and then add them together. But if you want 10% of your country’s coast to have any combination of these things, you would keep them together.

> In the Global Assessment framework, the Sense of Place sub-goals were weighted equally and combined in an average to create a single goal score. The two sub-goals are averaged currently in the framework. But these could be combined with a weighted average.
