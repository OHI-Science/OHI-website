The Habitats sub-goal includes all habitats in the study area, and assess their health condition and coverage area.

> Habitat is included in the Biodiversity goal to provide a more complete picture of diversity in the system. This is because in global assessments assessed species data were limited and the diversity of habitats can be included with the assumption that healthier habitats mean healthier species. Therefore if you have comprehensive species assessments in your area you may not need to include all habitats as a sub-goal, instead only including living habitats (algae, corals) along with species in the Species sub-goal.

### Ideal Approach

Ideally, information on the area extent (square kilometers) and condition of every habitat type would be available over a long period of time.

### Practical Guidance

You will first find what habitats are in your study area, both in the coastal regions and offshore. In the global assessments, data were available for mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, or subtidal soft-bottom habitats, but there are likely other important habitats in your region.

Once you determine what habitats are in your area, you will need information about the area extent of each habitat within each region of your study area. You should consider whether and how far they go offshore and inland. Spatial data are preferred: you will be able to calculate the total square kilometers of each habitat within each region. For example, in global assessments mangrove area within 1 kilometer of the coastline were included, but this distance could change in OHI+ assessments.

You will need to include area and condition data specific to your study area and not rely on the global data provided. This is because the habitat data provided for your assessment are either over-representative by allocating the study area’s data equally to each subcountry region, or can be misrepresentative by allocating a proportion of those data to each subcountry region (based on the offshore area of each region to the total area). Either case assumes that if a habitat was present in the country, it could be found anywhere (which is not the case with study areas that span many degrees of latitude), and the first case inflates the habitat coverage in the study area.

> TIP 1: Do you have maps that show current habitat distributions and maps that show historical habitat distributions? If so, you could extract that data for each of your regions to get a current and reference area. In the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014), researchers went to the local public library to find hand-drawn maps of historical salt marsh and sand dune extents in California. You could also use summarized habitat data that exists in tables or are already compiled in another source.

> TIP 2: If local data is not available, you obtain certain habitat extent data from the global assessment, which used high resolution spatial extend data from this study: Hamilton, S. & Casey, D. (2014). Creation of a high spatiotemporal resolution global database of continuous mangrove forest cover for the 21st Century (CGMFC-21): a big-data fusion approach. arXiv:1412.0722. Good data to obtain from this study include shoreline, mangrove, soft bottom, and sea ice.

The condition of the habitats can be measured in different ways, depending on the data available. Indicators of condition could include habitat density, susceptibility to pathogens, or change in species composition or growth rates from impacts such as overgrazing. Look for studies assessing habitat integrity or condition specifically in your area.

> In global assessments, direct information about coral condition was not available so it was based on the percentage of “living cover” on a coral reef relative to the potential range of the reef. In other words, estimates of coral cover within transects of certain sites were repeated in time and we used that rate of change in time as an indication of health of the reefs in the whole region. The difficulty lies in 1) having enough different locations sampled that you can say something about the whole region and 2) finding studies that did repeated measures in time, in the same location, over at least 20 years. In the Global 2013 assessment, there were so few datasets that satisfied this condition that we had to pool observations from different locations. Mean predicted values for each region from 1985-1987 were set as reference points.

If possible, you will want to gather habitat area and condition data through time so that you can calculate the trend. Ideally, there will be enough years of data to directly calculate the recent change in habitat condition as the trend. This isn’t always the case, and proxies or estimates might need to be used. For example, due to spotty salt marsh data we created trend categories of increasing (0.5), stable (0), and decreasing (-0.5) based on available data.

The reference point will likely be based on historic habitat area coverage and condition, with the assumption that habitat destruction has been and still is occurring and the target is to return to some point in the past. You will need historical data for this, from satellites, published papers, or even hand-drawn maps. The challenge is to find a reference point that is both ambitious and realistic (based on the S.M.A.R.T. principles: see Conceptual Guide), using the data available. If data allow, it will be possible to set a reference point that is more ambitious than that used in global assessments.

Alternatively, the reference point could be guided by a policy target. For example, are there any climate change policies in your area, with defined targets and objectives? Are there any restoration or carbon storage projects in your area? Do any organizations offer guidance on the amount of carbon storage your management policies should be aiming for?
