This sub-goal assesses the health of all marine species present in a region, including endangered species and species in relatively good conditions. The presence of higher-risk species leads to a higher score.

> Data for this goal are also used in Sense of Places sub-goal: Iconic Species. It will be effective for goal keepers of Biodiversity and Sense of Place to work together on data gathering.

### Ideal Approach

Ideally, you would find data for all species present in your region including information on their habitat ranges along with scientific studies that speak to the health of their populations.

### Practical Guidance

You should start by trying to find spatial information for species that occur in your area and determine whether or not they have been scientifically assessed and given a conservation status. It is best if you only use species for which there are both spatial data and an assessment. In the global assessment, we combined data from recent assessment the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data) and AquaMaps (aquamaps.org). These data sets provide a geographic snapshot of how total marine biodiversity is faring, even though it is a very small sub-sample of overall species diversity.

IUCN provides global species assessments that indicate the distribution and the conservation status of species, ranging from Least Concern to Critically Endangered to Extinct. These risk categories were turned into these into weights (between 0 and 1) for calculations. AquaMaps offers additional spatial data for species not covered by the IUCN distribution maps. Both evaluations chooses a taxon (e.g. sharks) and a group of world experts assess it comprehensively. Locally identified species identified in a regional assessment may not be in the global database because they do not belong to one of the taxa that have been selected for assessment, or because the experts that did the assessment did not know that information existed. In either case, there is no connection between what IUCN or AquaMaps report and what assessments are done locally. Therefore, it might not be fair to penalize a study area for missing species. For biodiversity, it is unrealistic to expect that all species are assessed, so it seems unfair to penalize for un-assessed species. In the fisheries goal, there are penalties for species that are exploited but not assessed, because if there are landings data, it means they are somewhat measurable, and so it is reasonable to expect they should be at least monitored.

For regional assessments, local studies of marine species status and local datasets are best here. The spatial information can be a range map with simple presence or absence information, or it can have more detailed data. You can complement the species list search with a scientific literature search to see if anyone has scored the species status in a way that you can use. One thing to keep in mind when using local data sets is that local lists might focus on endangered species and leave species in relatively good conditions un-assessed. This could result in poorer scores.

If spatial distribution information for individual species is not available, the goal model could be simplified to be based on threat-status-weighted average in your region.

You should also think about the reference point for scores that signal poor Biodiversity status. You can use the same threshold as the Global Assessments which say that places with extinction risk scores greater than seventy-five percent will get scores of zero. This is an estimation based on the literature of mass extinctions (e.g., Barnosky et al., 2011) and could be applied across scales. You don’t need all species extinct for there to be a zero, so you will have to choose how to rescale it, and whether the risk effects are linear or nonlinear.


### Additional Note: Defining spatial regions and map considerations

Once you have gathered the data, the treatment of it will matter for the model and goal score calculation. Do you know how the data were collected? Do you have information on sampling effort? If you don’t know, you may not be sure whether changes in condition are due to monitoring efforts or biodiversity change, and you therefore may want to consider the uncertainty of your model.

In any case, the original logic of the Species sub-goal of the Biodiversity goal is to represent the species present relative to the proportion of their range within a given region. The goal is to summarize extinction risk for an area across assessed species, and assign it appropriately so that the loss of species scores poorly. You should consider whether the impacts to local species status are linear or non-linear. Will drawing borders affect how your scores are assigned?

When considering how to change the model, you should think about the outcome of the score on your decisions. For instance, will weighting a “Critically Endangered” species higher on the scale result in the inclusion or exclusion of more rare species? Will the way you aggregate spatial data to summarize extinction risk for your area take into account the influence of species with smaller ranges size, or will that information be lost in the averaging process? An inherent disadvantage for conservation may occur when rare species get rarer in the future, and will therefore have a relatively small influence on the score while common species drive the results.

Range size has an impact on score results. For example, if you use the current model, none of the cone snail species listed below will have a big impact on the Species sub-goal score because to their small range size that covers one cell of map area. However, the 0.8 score for Conus roeckeli shows that it is a rare species as assessed by the IUCN. On the other hand, the coral Acropora palmata is also rare and yet covers a large range.
