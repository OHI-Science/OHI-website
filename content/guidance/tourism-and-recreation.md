Tourism and recreation in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems. A score of 100 means a region sustainably realizes its full recreational potential.


> This goal is not about the revenue or livelihoods that are generated by tourism and recreation (that is captured in other goals) but instead captures the value that people have for experiencing and enjoying coastal areas. 

#### Practial Guidance

This goal can take many different directions and draw from a wide range of data sources. This goal can benefit from creating thinking, as demonstrated by many OHI+ assessments (see below for ideas)! For example, in the Brazil Assessment the density of hotel employees per state was used as a proxy of how well visited coastal areas were.

A good starting point is to consider how people use and enjoy the ocean in your region and then try to determine the information that could capture this. 

For example, you may be able to find information describing the number of visitors to surf areas, beaches, hiking trails, etc. Or, the number of people buying fishing licences or parking passes. 

Other types of information that could be useful, include: boat rentals, resort registries, whale watching and bird watching tours. Social media posts could be a rich data source, but will take considerable skill to harvest and analyze. General information such as whether people have access to beaches, boating areas, or to surfing spots could be useful.

The best way to represent the sustainability term for this goal is to use a local indicator or a measure of tourism sustainability or competitiveness. Otherwise, use the TTCI value from the Global 2013 assessment for the study area (applied evenly across all regions).

The reference point will depend on the type of data. Does your country have industry growth rate targets? Do you want to increase tourism, or ensure it does not decline?
