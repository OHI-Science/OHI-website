This goal assesses the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). 

A score of 100 indicates habitats that provide coastal protection are intact or have been restored to their reference conditions.

> Habitat-based goals (Storage, Coastal Protection, and Biodiversity) should be considered together during the data gathering process because the same data underly these goals.

#### Practical Guidance

*_STEP 1: Identify relevant habitats_*
You will first determine the habitats in your study that protect marine coastlines. In global assessments, coral, mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses, and sea ice were included. 

We generally do not include an assessment of the protection afforded by man-made structures, such as jetties and seawalls. These structures cannot be preserved without maintenance and often have negative side effects (e.g., alter sedimentation rates causing erosion in new locations), thus they do not constitute long-term sustainable service and are mostly seen as a pressure. It gets tricky when structures are built to help reduce coastal erosionâ€“they are still manmade and therefore not a natural benefit that the ocean provides. But if data allow, it might be possible to include tradeoff effects: maybe in areas where natural habitats are degraded and man-made structures have been built to reduce erosion, we could reduce the pressure that would otherwise be applied.

*_STEP 2: Determine contribution of each habitat_*

The relative contribution of each habitat to total coastal protection is based on the area of the habitat and the relative protection it provides.  For the Global Assessment, the protective ability of each habitat was based on relative weights obtained from the [Natural Capital Project](https://ohi-science.org/goals/www.naturalcapitalproject.org). Depending on the habitats you include, you will need to find additional weights.

*_STEP 3: Determine habitat condition_*

The score for this ultimately depends on the health of each habitat. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full potential.

The reference point for assessing the condition of habitats will likely be temporal, meaning you will compare the current area of these habitats to some area in the past, and thus historic data are needed. Reference points could also be set by with a proportion increase (or decrease) of known conditions. 

Review the section on Biodiversity sub-goal: Habitats for guidance on habitat extent and condition.


*_STEP 4: Other considerations_*

OHI+ assessments for Coastal Protection may also incorporate additional variables at the local scale.  Physical properties may be available, allowing for more a detailed understanding of the protective ability, and likelihood of exposure for different portions of the coastline. Models may also incorporate estimates of the vulnerability of coastline regions to inundation, due to potential financial loss as well as costs to human life, structures, or habitats.
