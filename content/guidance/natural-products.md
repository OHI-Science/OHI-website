This goal assesses the ability of countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources that are not consumed as food by humans, such as sponges, fishoil and fishmeal, shells, seaweeds, mangrove wood, and fish for the aquarium trade.

> Similar to Food Provisions, this goal is trying to capture the value of goods sustainably harvested by the ocean. While Food Provision focuses on goods for human consumption, Natural Products assesses non-food goods. As these two goals often share similar data sources, it may be time-saving for the goal keepers of these two goals to work together and gather data.

#### Practial Guidance

*_STEP 1: Identify the products in your study area_*
The first is to identify identify which products are in your study area. For example, does your study area have corals, ornamental fishes, sponges? Does your area yield medicines from the sea, or other products that are not used for nutrition under Food Provision? Does your area harvest drinking water from the ocean through desalination plants? Is there a kelp or seaweed industry in your area? If there are multiple uses of the product, you must also consider what proportion of the product is used for food, and what proportion is used for other purposes. As another example, oil from marine mammals was considered but excluded from the global models, but if a region has a considerable amount of mammal oil harvest, they should include it in the calculation, keeping in mind that the sustainability of this type of harvest is likely to be low and should be reflected in the score.

> This goal does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable.


*_STEP 2: Gather the data_*

After identifying the natural products to include in the model you will need to find the appropriate data. Ideally, you will find information about the quantity and location of species harvested (tonnes), the sustainability of the harvest practice, and, potentially, the value of the product.

The global assessment includes seaweed (the portion not consumed by humans as food, see Table 6.12 in [methods](https://ohi-science.org/ohiprep_v2021/Reference/methods_and_results/Supplement.html#68_Natural_products)), fishoil/fishmeal, and ornamental fish. We excluded some natural products due to a lack of global data (e.g., mangrove wood harvest), or being highly variable (e.g., shells), or non-sustainable (e.g., mammal oil and coral). However, localities could use different criteria. 

> In the global assessments, the tonnes and value of the natural product harvest is from the [UNâ€™s Food and Agriculture Administration](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/statistics/software/fishstatj/en). These data are compiled and reported by product for each country, and available by downloading the FishStatJ software.

The goal model should also incorporate an indicator of  *sustainability* for each product.  It is possible to measure sustainability in a number of different ways. Quantitative information can be used, or expert judgment, perhaps based on information or rough estimates of how sustainable the harvest method is.

For the global assessment, we assess sustainability in several ways. In the case of fishoil/fishmeal, we filter the Fisheries subgoal data to include only the fish stocks used for fish oil/meal (see table 6.12 in [methods](https://ohi-science.org/ohiprep_v2021/Reference/methods_and_results/Supplement.html#68_Natural_products). For seaweed mariculture we use the mariculture sustainability scores from the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendations).

*_STEP 3: Determine the reference point_*

The next important thing to consider is the reference point for the harvest amount for each product. Setting the reference point is a decision your team must make based on the available data and an inferred functional relationship between the harvest of the product and the amount in the system. Understanding the patterns in harvest can help inform how to set the reference point. For example, knowing whether harvesting effort was constant or whether product yields changed due to the market demand and not the availability. This information could help inform whether it is more appropriate to set the reference point as the peak yield of the time-series, or some percentage above or below, or some other approach that is both ambitious and realistic (SMART principles). The decision you make for the reference point should be based on the trend of the data; for instance, if your harvests have only increased over time, which may be indicative of an emerging economy, you will have to account for that.


*_STEP 4: Combine all the information_*

The status of each natural product is estimated separately based on a model that takes into account harvest amount relative to the reference point and the sustainability of the harvest.

The status values of the individual products are then averaged. The contribution of each product to the average can be weighted by tonnes of harvest or the value of the harvest.
