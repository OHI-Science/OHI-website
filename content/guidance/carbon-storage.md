This goal captures the ability of coastal marine environments to store carbon in key habitats.

Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems store substantially more carbon than terrestrial forests and have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts. This goal intends to capture the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given the amount of carbon they store and/or their carbon uptake rate and the condition of the habitat. 

A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential.

> Habitat-based goals (Storage, Coastal Protection, and Biodiversity) should be considered together during the data gathering process because these goals use the same data.

#### Practical Guidance

*_STEP 1: Identify relevant habitats_*

You will first determine the habitats in your study that contribute to carbon sequestration and storage. 

Examples of habitats that are important for carbon sequestration and storage are mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses. It is possible that there are other carbon-sequestering habitats present in your study area. But we recommend using habitats that can store carbon on the order of 100 years, thereby limiting the types of habitat types that be relevant to this goal. 

> Seaweeds and coral store carbon for less than 100 years, and are not included in the carbon storage goal. Although the pelagic oceanic carbon sink (phytoplankton) plays a large role in the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon, the pelagic ocean mechanisms are not amenable to local or regional management intervention. Phytoplankton contribute to carbon fixation when they die and sink to the sea bottom at sufficient depth. However, if those phytoplankton are eaten, the carbon is cycled back into the system and not sequestered. Something that could potentially be included in the carbon storage goal is mollusc shells, if they are added to a landfill and not recycled in the sea. If information on mariculture production and waste disposal are available, this could be an interesting addition to carbon storage at a regional scale.

*_STEP 2: Determine contribution of each habitat_*

Within a region the capacity of the habitat to remove carbon is based on the amount of habitat (typically, area, km^2) and its carbon storage and/or uptake rates.  These values are used to weight the contribution of each habitat to the region score.  

This information will require searching the literature for descriptions of the organic nutrient uptake of each habitat. Ideally these studies should represent your study area. For example, were the studies done with a young mangrove forest, or an older one, which might have different growth rates?

Understanding habitat carbon storage rates is an area of ongoing research. 

*_STEP 3: Determine habitat condition_*

The score for this ultimately depends on the health of each habitat. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential.

The reference point for assessing the condition of habitats will likely be temporal, meaning you will compare the current area of these habitats to some area in the past, and thus historic data are needed. Reference points could also be set by with a proportion increase (or decrease) of known conditions.
