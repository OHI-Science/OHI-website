### 10 YEARS OF SCORES! 

The OHI 2021 global assessment includes scores from 2012 to 2021 for 220 coastal countries and territories.  

This is a BIG deal because this marks our 10th year of calculating the global Ocean Health Index. You can now download 10 years of data which makes the OHI a very useful resource for exploring changes in the sustainable use of ocean resources over time.

The downloadable dataset includes global and country index scores as well as the goal scores and components used to calculate the scores (see score [metadata](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/yearly_results/README.md#global-ohi-score-metadata) for a description of the data).  See [Methodology tab](https://ohi-science.org/OHI-website/methodology/) for an overview of OHI score calculations. 

Every year we improve the Ocean Health Index by incorporating new data, knowledge, and feedback. In order to make scores comparable among years, we recalculate previous year's results using the most recent methods and data.

### PREPARATION MATERIALS 

In addition to providing scores, we make all the code used to prepare data and calculate scores available online on GitHub. 

Data are prepared and scores calculated using freely available coding and version control software. In the interest of transparency and to promote scientific discovery that builds off our methods, we freely provide the data and scripts used to calculate the global Ocean Health Index. However, we do not provide unaltered data obtained from other sources, to obtain these data you must go the original data sources.

Extra materials we use to calculate scores are available from these locations:

- [Preparing data: ](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2019) GitHub repository (ohiprep) with scripts used to prepare data. We also have a [document](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2018/blob/gh-pages/src/dataOrganization_SOP.md#sop-for-data-management-for-ocean-health-index-assessments) describing how these files are organized.  
- [Calculating scores: ](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/releases) GitHub repository (ohi-global) with scripts used to calculate scores.
- [OHI Global Guide: ](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global-guide/index.html) A (very) detailed manual for conducting the global assessment.
- [Large data files: ](https://mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/data/) Extra data too large to host on GitHub.
