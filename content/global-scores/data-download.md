We enthusiastically support the use of our data, but please cite our work.

Global OHI assessments require synthesizing data from nearly one hundred sources. 
Data are prepared and scores calculated using freely available coding and version control software. In the interest of transparency and the promotion of scientific discovery, we freely provide the data and scripts used to calculate the global Ocean Health Index. 

We do not provide unaltered data obtained from other sources; to obtain these data you must go the original data sources we provide in methods documents.

Every year we improve the Ocean Health Index by incorporating new data, knowledge, and feedback. In order to make scores comparable among years, we always recalculate previous year's results using the most recent methods and data. In addition to providing scores, we make all code available online on GitHub.  


**Ocean Health Index scores**

The OHI 2020 assessment includes scores for years 2012 - 2020 for 220 coastal countries and territories.
