The global Ocean Health Index measures the state of the world’s oceans. 

The global OHI score for the 2021 assessment was XXX. The interactive map shows  how different countries and goals contributed to this score, as well as how the score has changed from 2012. Click on colored regions (i.e. EEZ region) to see short summaries of scores by country.

Results are shown for the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 220 coastal countries or territories.  EEZ's describe an area that extends 200 nautical miles (370 KM) offshore from a country’s coast where it assumes jurisdiction over the exploration and use of resources. 

A country's Index score is the average of 10 "goal" scores which represent the ecological, social, and economic benefits that people expect from healthy oceans.  Each goal is scored from 0 to 100 based on the delivery of benefits with respect to a sustainable target. Lower scores indicate that more benefits could be gained or that current methods are harming the delivery of future benefits.  When a goal is not relevant to a specific region, no value (N/A) is shown and that goal is not included in calculation of the region's overall Index score.

The global score is the average of the country scores, weighted by EEZ area.
