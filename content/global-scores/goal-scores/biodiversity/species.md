### PRESERVING MARINE SPECIES

This goal measures the conservation status of marine species. 

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="SPP" >}}


A high score indicates that most native species in a given country are free from risk (invasive species are excluded), and it is 0 when up to 75% of native species are at high risk (this is a level comparable to prehistoric mass extinctions).

It is important to recognize that this score represents a small sample of existing marine biodiversity, since IUCN data currently only exists for a small percentage of known marine species. Moreover, there are likely many more species that exist but have not yet been described. 

The current score indicates that many marine species are at risk and there is potential risk of losing a significant proportion of marine species diversity. The [IUCN Red List of Threatened Species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) estimates that 28% of all assessed species are at risk of extinction. 

Trends in the Species sub-goal are concerning. The global score has, on average, dropped nearly a third of a point every year since 2012. This decline is mainly due to improving IUCN Red List data across assessments. For example, since 2018, nearly 3000 more species have been added to the IUCN Red List assessment, many of which were classified as a threatened category.
