### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="LIV" >}}

Sadly, the Livelihoods subgoal has not been meaningfully updated since the origin of the global Ocean Health Index in 2012. The datasets we used for this model were discontinued, and we have been unable to find good replacements.

Please contact us if you have any good leads on data we could use to calculate this goal!
