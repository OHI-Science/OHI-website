### SUSTAINING JOBS AND THRIVING COASTAL ECONOMIES
This goal measures jobs and revenue from sustainable marine-related industries. This goal is divided into two subgoals because the number and quality of jobs (Livelihoods) and the amount of revenue produced (Economies) are both of considerable interest to stakeholders and governments, and can have different patterns in some cases.

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="LE" >}}

Sadly, the Livelihoods and Economies goal has not been meaningfully updated since the origin of the global Ocean Health Index in 2012. The datasets we used for this model were discontinued, and we have been unable to find good replacements.

We are working on updating this goal with current day data!
