### MARINE ENVIRONMENTS SUPPORT ECONOMIES
The Economies goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors, such as commercial fishing, mariculture, tourism and recreation, shipping and transportation, whale watching, ports and harbors, ship and boat building, and renewable energy production.

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="ECO" >}}

Sadly, the Economies subgoal has not been meaningfully updated since the origin of the global Ocean Health Index in 2012. The datasets we used for this model were discontinued, and we have been unable to find good replacements.

Please let us know if you have any good leads on data we could use to calculate this goal!
