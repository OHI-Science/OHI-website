### PRESERVING HABITATS THAT ABSORB CARBON

This goal captures the ability of coastal habitats to store carbon given the amount of carbon they store and their health.

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="CS" >}}

The current score indicates that the four habitats assessed for carbon storage- mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and tidal flats - are still relatively healthy and intact on a global basis.

Generally we know that there is a global decline in carbon storing habitat extent and health since 1980, but for the most part this is hard to monitor, and much of the data associated with these habitats are of poor quality (aside from mangroves). In particular, habitat health data is extremely lacking, and for all of our carbon storing habitats but mangroves we do not have data which are tracked over time. As a result, most of our habitat layers rely on global health values. For this reason, we see a relatively stagnant global score for the Carbon Storage goal.
