### PRESERVING HABITATS THAT SAFEGUARD SHORES
This goal aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). 

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

The current score indicates that although, in many places, these habitats remain healthy and intact, the extents of all five habitats have been substantially reduced or degraded when compared to their reference years.  The declines observed have occurred over only about three decades. 

Coastal protection scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.
