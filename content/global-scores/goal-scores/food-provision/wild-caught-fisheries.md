### AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL FOOD SOURCE
This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught fisheries.

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="FIS" >}}

The current score indicates that most regions are significantly below their sustainable target values. Many regions are jeopardizing future catch with overharvesting, while a few are not producing as much wild-caught seafood as they could.

The trends in global Fisheries are concerning. The global score has, on average, dropped nearly a third of a point every year since 2012. This decline is due mainly to the decreasing sustainability of fisheries, which means many stocks are being overfished. 

There are however, some success stories hidden in the data. Palau is a country that has highly regulated fisheries and marine protected areas, and this is reflected in their score (92 in 2021). We expect this score to increase even more in the future, once the benefits of their new [National Marine Sanctuary](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/01/01/palau-national-marine-sanctuary-goes-into-effect) are realized in data.
