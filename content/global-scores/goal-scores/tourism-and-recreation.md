### THE DRAW OF THE OCEAN
Coastal and marine tourism is a vital part of a country’s economy. This goal measures participation in sustainable tourism to coastal regions. 

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="TR" >}}

In this year’s assessment we were able to procure travel and tourism data up to 2021 from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) new [Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI)](https://www.weforum.org/reports/travel-and-tourism-development-index-2021/). This allowed us to get a glimpse of the pandemic’s impact on global tourism. 

The Tourism Sustainability data layer was formerly based on the WEF’s [Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI)](https://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2019/rankings/). The organization has replaced the TTCI with the previously mentioned successor, the TTDI. According to the WEF, the two indices are not directly comparable so we can’t reliably extract meaning from the changes incurred from updating that layer. However, the current TTDI contains back calculated scores for 2019, so we can glean some insight from comparing 2019 values to those of 2021. We specifically used the “Travel & Tourism Sustainability Subindex'' for our purposes, which consists of three pillars: Environmental Sustainability, Socio-economic Resilience and Conditions, and Travel and Tourism Demand Pressure and Impact. Scores generally increased among assessment regions. The sub index scale ranges from 1 at the low end to 7 at the high end — on average regions increased 0.022 points between 2019 and 2021. 
 
Our methods of calculating The Percent Direct Employment in Tourism data layer have changed slightly due to data accessibility, but the values are all derived from [WTTC tourism employment data](https://wttc.org/). The reported changes between 2019 and 2020 are quite drastic — unsurprisingly given the pandemic. Percent direct employment in tourism decreased in every single region for which data were available. The three largest decreases in percentage points according to our results took place in the Bahamas (-12.8), Aruba (-8.8), and Seychelles (-7.5). The list goes on for a while before a non-island nation shows up. The mean change for all regions during this period was -1.58 points. Fortunately we see a general rebound, albeit less dramatic, the following year — presumably as a result of vaccine roll outs and general border re-openings. Regions in the assessment saw a mean increase of 0.46 percentage points of direct employment in tourism between 2020 and 2021. The top three largest increases in percentage points occurred in Aruba (+5.2), the Bahamas (+4.4), and Saint Lucia (+2.1). 

The countries with the lowest scores have unsafe or unappealing conditions owing to poverty, political turmoil, war or other volatile conditions and scores will likely be depressed until those fundamental conditions improve. Once these conditions are resolved, improvements to Tourism and Recreation can occur rapidly. In Sri Lanka, 2009 marked the end of a 25 year civil war, and since then the proportion of people employed in tourism has more than doubled.

Overall, the global Tourism and Recreation score has increased modestly from 2012 to 2019, with a dramatic decline starting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic
