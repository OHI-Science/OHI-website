### CLEAN WATERS ARE IMPORTANT
The Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by human-made causes. 

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="CW" >}}

The current score indicates that there large opportunities for improvement. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero. Reducing the inflow of chemicals, nutrients, human and animal wastes and trash requires remedial actions at every level of society as well as adjustments to behavior on an individual basis.

Overall, the Clean Waters goal has increased modestly since 2012. The global score has, on average, increased by one fifth of a point every year since 2012. This increase is likely due to a decrease in human derived pathogens in waterways (more people have access to improved sanitation facilities), and a decrease in land-based nitrogen input associated with manure and fertilizer application. 

Generally we see that small island regions with low population, or islands that are uninhabited score well. This is because these regions have little to no agricultural fertilizer use or chemical pollution, and if uninhabited, no human derived pathogens. The region that has the highest score that is not an island is Canada, a developed country with highly regulated agricultural practices.
