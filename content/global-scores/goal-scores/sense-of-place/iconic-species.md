### Protecting culturally significant species

The iconic species subgoal measures the conservation status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.

### CURRENT SCORE

{{< gauge regionId="0" goalCode="SPP" >}}

A high score indicates that few to none of the iconic species in a countryâ€™s EEZ have been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered, threatended, vulnerable, or at risk of extinction. A low score indicates that many are in those categories.

The current score indicates that iconic marine species are not as well protected as possible in many places. Substantial conservation efforts will be required in order to improve the status of many iconic species that call the ocean home.


Iconic species scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.
