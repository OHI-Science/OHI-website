## What Makes a Border?

{{<newsHead>}}

When you think of a border, what comes to mind? The line drawn between countries? The landmass of a continent? The nested pieces of county or province lines? All of these things represent different ways nations have attempted to shape the flow of goods, ideas, and people across a landscape. Borders serve as physical and ideological boundaries between people, places, and things.

> “Territorial borders both shape and are shaped by what they contain, and what crosses or is prevented from crossing them.” - Anderson & O'Dowd 1999[^FOOTNOTE]. 

When you view the map of [OHI global scores](/global-scores/), you’ll notice that each region has a distinct boundary along it’s coastline that indicates the sovereign waters of that nation. This boundary is referred to as the **Exclusive Economic Zone**, or **EEZ**. The EEZ is a 200 nautical mile area off a nation's coastline where the state has jurisdiction over coastal resources. More specifically, it's where a nation has the right to explore, manage, conserve, and exploit natural resources in the sea and seabed [^FOOTNOTE].
