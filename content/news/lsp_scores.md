<h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Lasting Special Places Sub-goal: Protected Areas and their Environmental Impacts</h1>


{{<newsHead>}}

The Lasting Special Places (LSP) sub-goal of the Sense of Place goal within the Ocean Health Index (OHI) aims to quantify “how well we are protecting the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity” [(OHI, n.d., para. 1)]( https://oceanhealthindex.org/global-scores/goal-scores/sense-of-place/lasting-special-places/). We look at that in terms of meeting a threshold of protection: 30% of coastal area protected for a given OHI region translates to a score of 100 for this sub-goal, with coastal area defined as the combined area 3 nautical miles (nm) offshore and 1 kilometer (km) inland along the OHI region’s coast. The LSP sub-goal stands out in the OHI assessment because it is the only score that has almost exclusively increased over the years (as protected areas typically are not lost). The graph below depicts the change in the global score (the average across the score dimension across OHI regions) over time.

This means that we are continuing to approach the global movement’s goal of having at least 30% of the blue planet protected by 2030, supporting environmental health and sustainability [(World Ocean Day, n.d.)](https://worldoceanday.org/take-action/conservation-action-focus/). While this is very positive news, people may be left wondering: what exactly counts as “protected areas,” which are an integral part in calculating the scores for the LSP goal? How effective are these “protected areas” at creating environmental benefits? 

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers a “protected area” a “clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values” [(IUCN Definition, 2008, as cited in IUCN, n.d., under heading “What are effective protected areas”)](https://www.iucn.org/our-work/topic/effective-protected-areas). This can include “national parks, wilderness areas, community conserved areas, nature reserves and so on” [(IUCN, n.d., under heading “About effective protected areas”)](https://www.iucn.org/our-work/topic/effective-protected-areas). Marine protected areas (MPAs), specifically, can include sites such as “marine parks, marine conservation zones, marine reserves, marine sanctuaries, and no-take zones” [(National Geographic, n.d., para. 3)](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/importance-marine-protected-areas/). 

Protected areas in general have been considered to assist with global biodiversity retention, but it is unclear how much they protect from local extinctions in their current state [(Williams et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2200118119). In addition, they are often not big enough, lack enough suitable habitat, and/or lack proper connections to provide resilience for various species. 

MPAs have levels of protection: fully protected areas prevent all extractive activities, strongly protected areas prevent commercial extractive activities and allow only some recreational extractive activities, and partially protected areas (the most common level of protection) are increasingly more lenient [(Grorud-Colvert & Lubchenco, 2017)](https://theconversation.com/momentum-grows-for-ocean-preserves-how-well-do-they-work-65625). MPAs can lead to increases in marine biomass, greater resilience in response to environmental change, and increases in fish abundance, which can also assist areas external to the MPA. Partially protected areas are much less likely to show these benefits to the degree of fully or strongly protected areas. 

Further, MPAs often cause fishing effort to move from the protected area to other areas or result in the increased use of terrestrial environments for food production (often with higher ecological impacts) [(Hilborn, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsx068). It has been claimed that “MPAs only protect the ocean from legal, regulated fishing,” they most benefit areas experiencing high fishing pressure, and that other forms of fisheries management should be used before MPAs when possible [(p. 1161)](https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsx068). The measurement of the effectiveness of MPAs also relies on evaluation; however, “adaptive management studies that incorporate monitoring data, let alone adequate data on the appropriate time scales for ascertaining responses to management, are lacking” [(Nickols et al., 2019, p. 2383)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13463). Overall, MPAs often do not have the proper levels and kinds of protection and management to provide environmental benefits to the most useful extent. 

While reaching the global protection goal of marine areas would be beneficial, how beneficial it is depends on how we implement MPAs and other protected areas and on what other strategies are used in combination with these, not just the total area protected.
