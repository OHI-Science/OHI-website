# OHI Onboarding

[OHI Onboarding](http://ohi-science.org/onboarding/) is a reference guide to help you begin your independent OHI assessment (OHI+). It provides links to open data science and OHI Toolbox training resources for each phase of an OHI+ assessments.

## Learn about the OHI

The Ocean Health Index is a comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates a suite of goals that deliver benefits to humans. It can be tailored to identify and capture important factors in different contexts. Learn whether the OHI is the right assessment tool for your area or learn from previous assessments to identify opportunities in subsequent assessments.

## Plan an OHI+ assessment

Planning an OHI+ assessment requires identifying the needs and spatial area of the assessment, establishing objectives and a timeline of activities, determining necessary resources (human and financial), and aligning the assessment process with existing efforts and initiatives. Further, it is important to identify and include collaborators, including key stakeholders or decision-makers.

## Conduct an OHI+ assessment
Conducting an assessment requires tailoring the OHI framework to the local context and using the Toolbox software to calculate scores based on this framework. This requires conceptually identifying important characteristics and priorities in the area, and gathering existing information and developing models to represent the framework. An emphasis is on transparency and reproducible science.

OHI Toobox Training is a hands-on training book introducing you to the OHI Toolbox and how to use it to calculate OHI scores, and provide guidance as your team prepares to use the Toolbox. It is built off open data science tools and practices. The training is accompanied by its predecessor, the [OHI Manual](https://ohi-science.org/manual/), which is a guide for the Conduct phase of the OHI process, including the Toolbox. It is not written as a hands-on training, but is the most comprehensive handbook of information to guide OHI assessments. The manual is not updated as frequently as the Toolbox Training.

Another potential resource (that may have more details than anyone wants) is the [reference guide](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global-guide/index.html) we use to conduct our OHI global assessment.

## Inform using OHI+ assessment results

The scores produced from the assessment process, as well as what was learned through the process itself, should be shared. Along with final scores and methods, it is important to transparently describe successes and challenges of the process (including information and knowledge gaps). These can help to prioritize policy decisions and can also make future assessments more efficient.
