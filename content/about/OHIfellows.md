## About the OHI Fellows Program

The Ocean Health Index Global Fellowship was created to provide training to a small group of early-career data scientists. 

During the process of calculating OHI scores, the fellows dive into the theory, tools, and workflows the OHI uses to ensure openness, transparency, and reproducibility. The Fellows gain valuable experience and build useful skills.

We benefit from their fresh eyes and new perspectives. Their contributions help the OHI grow and innovate. 

This program is an integral part of what the Ocean Health Index has accomplished thus far and what it is today.

## Current Fellows

The 2023 Fellows are three students in the Environmental Data Science program at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management.

<p>
Erika has always had a wide variety of interests and has strived to continuously embrace all of her different passions. During her undergraduate education at UC Santa Barbara, where she entered as a Regents Scholar, she decided to triple major in Environmental Studies, Linguistics (Emphasis in Language and Speech Technologies), and History of Art and Architecture (Emphasis in Architecture and Environment), graduating in 2022 with highest honors and membership in Phi Beta Kappa. During this time, she developed a greater passion for computational data analysis methods and a depth of issues at the intersection of her three primary fields of study. Her research experience has included lab, field, and data analysis work related to marine chemical analysis, landscape restoration, urban forestry, food security, and the environmental impacts of COVID-19. 
</p> 
<p>
She is now pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and hopes to apply her interdisciplinary lens to analyzing urban-centered socio-environmental topics, resulting in the improvement of the quality and sustainability of human interactions with built and natural environments. Concurrently, she initially assisted with research data management for the Arctic Data Center at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) and then transitioned to her current position as an OHI Fellow. Growing up along the coast and seeing tourism-centered human-ocean interactions firsthand, she developed a passion for supporting a positive relationship between humans and marine environmental processes and is excited to learn how to more effectively support the processes she cares deeply about.

<p>
Juliet is an aspiring wildlife biologist and marine data scientist interested in the interactions between landscapes, wildlife populations, and human livelihoods in the face of climate change. She is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science from UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. Prior to the Bren School, she earned a Bachelor’s degree in Ecology and Evolution from UC Santa Barbara and studied tropical biology in Costa Rica. Her undergraduate research investigated mammalian ecology and mariculture systems. Following this research, she served as a field technician studying endangered populations of flat-tailed horned lizards and steelhead trout in Southern California, as well as invasive species across the Hawaiian islands. These field roles inspired her to delve into environmental data science in order to recognize broad ecological patterns across scientific disciplines. 
</p>
<p>
Moving forward at the Ocean Health Index, she hopes to contribute to our understanding of marine health on a global scale. With open source programming tools and a collaborative approach, she hopes to advise policies to protect habitats, wildlife, and human livelihoods. In her free time, Juliet enjoys snorkeling, surfing, climbing, and playing with her pet gecko, Bembe.

<img src="/images/people/Menzies_Peter_mountains.jpg" style="float: right; width: 40%; margin: 0px 6px;" /></a>
<p>

Peter grew up in North Carolina, and studied terrestrial plant ecology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville where his passion for the natural world blossomed into a career path. After several years of involvement in ecology research among the southern Appalachian Mountains, he spent three years as an Environmental Educator for a small nonprofit in Asheville. 

In his free time, when he wasn’t climbing rocks, Peter started teaching himself to code and was drawn to the idea of applying data science techniques to combat environmental issues. Following this goal, he drove across the country with his two cats and is now pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science degree at UC Santa Barbara’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. After living alongside the Pacific for the better part of a year, Peter has found a passion for marine ecosystems and is thrilled to apply his growing data science skill set to assessing global ocean health as an OHI Fellow.

</a>
<p>
Cullen is a marine ecologist with expertise in long term monitoring of kelp forest environments in California. He graduated from Humboldt State University in 2014 where he studied history, mathematics, and scientific diving. Cullen worked five seasons with Channel Islands National Park's Kelp Forest Monitoring Program where he developed his skills in subtidal field methods. Cullen is interested in how ecological communities change in response to environmental stressors such as climate patterns, fishing pressure, and disease events. Working for a long term monitoring program inspired him to return to school to learn analytical methods that would allow him to better understand the historical context of the data he was helping to collect.
</p> 
<p>
Cullen is currently a master’s candidate of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. At Bren, Cullen has been excited about working with spatial data and remote sensing technologies. He uses these skills for his capstone project where his team is developing a workflow that uses satellite imagery and machine learning to make crop yield predictions in sub-Saharan Africa. As a global OHI fellow, Cullen is excited to continue working in marine science with his expanded data processing, modeling, and presentation skills. He is glad to participate in a program that seeks to improve our understanding of the health of our global oceans.
