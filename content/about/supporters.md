We are grateful for the generous support from the Pacific Life Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, as well as our founding contributors for helping us build the Ocean Health Index from the beginning. Without their generosity of intellectual and financial support the Ocean Health Index would not be a reality.

### The Pacific Life Foundation

The Pacific Life Foundation made a commitment in 2011 to become the Founding Presenting Sponsor of the Ocean Health Index. The Foundation has a strong tradition of creating positive societal change through its grant making program. Established in 1984 and headquartered in Newport Beach, CA, the Pacific Life Foundation is the charitable giving arm of Pacific Life Insurance Company and, during that time, has contributed over $84 million in donations to thousands of nonprofits.

### The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation enables lasting, meaningful change through sustained, scientifically sound philanthropy, seeking to achieve through philanthropy what Gordon Moore accomplished for the world of computing: to create an ever more powerful engine of progress in society.

### The World Ocean Observatory

The World Ocean Observatory is a major utility for ocean communication as a means to advance public awareness and political will, dedicated to providing information and education about the health of the ocean. Online at [World Ocean](worldoceanobservatory.org).

### William Wrigley Jr.

Since 2007, William Wrigley Jr. provided vision, support and leadership to this project. He generously provided the founding grant to the Ocean Health Index. He was an early originator of the Ocean Health Index concept and nurtured its development through leadership of the Ocean Health Council, bringing together the best in business thinking and marine conservation 

Mr. Wrigley is a Board member at Conservation International, co-chair of CIâ€™s Ocean Health Council, the former Chairman and CEO of the William Wrigley, Jr. Company, and an avid SCUBA-diver.
