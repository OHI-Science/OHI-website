Our founding contributors go above and beyond in their generosity of intellectual and financial support. Without these forward-thinking leaders, the Ocean Health Index would not be a reality.

### FOUNDING PRESENTING SPONSOR
The Pacific Life Foundation has a strong tradition of creating positive societal change through its grant making program. The Foundation made a commitment in 2011 to become the Founding Presenting Sponsor of the Ocean Health Index as it has the potential to stimulate a reversal in ocean health, from negative to positive. It will be a valuable tool for citizens and policymakers to track the health of the global ocean, as well as the health of their regional and local ocean. We hope that the tools provided through the Index will enable and inspire policymakers to improve ocean governance and health.

Established in 1984 and headquartered in Newport Beach, CA, the Pacific Life Foundation is the charitable giving arm of Pacific Life Insurance Company and, during that time, has contributed over $84 million in donations to thousands of nonprofits.

### FOUNDING GRANT
Beau and Heather Wrigley generously provided the founding grant to the Ocean Health Index. Mr. and Mrs. Wrigley brought together the best in business thinking and marine conservation; they were early originators of the Ocean Health Index concept and nurtured its development through their leadership of the Ocean Health Council. 

Since 2007, Mr. and Mrs. Wrigley have provided vision, support and leadership to this project. Mr. Wrigley is a Board member at Conservation International, co-chair of CIâ€™s Ocean Health Council, the former Chairman and CEO of the William Wrigley, Jr. Company, and an avid SCUBA-diver.
