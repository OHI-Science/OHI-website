## What is the Ocean Health Index?

> The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is a tailorable framework to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate ocean health.

The Ocean Health Index was originally developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists to assess global ocean health. This was a huge success and, the global OHI assessment has been repeated every year since 2012! **This year we are celebrating 10 years of OHI!**


You can explore the global OHI scores in a variety of ways:

The OHI framework has since been applied to many different regions, which we refer to as OHI+ assessments.  The beauty of the OHI framework is that it can be tailored to different spatial scales and can accomodate a range of contexts and values. This is possible because the core framework of how goals are scored does not change while the goal models can be adapted to accomodate local information and decisions.

still working on...

The Ocean Health Index measures progress towards a suite of key societal ‘goals’ representing the benefits and services people expect healthy oceans to provide.  


This framework scores By analyzing these goals together and scoring them from 0-100, OHI assessments provide an integrated picture of the state of the ecosystem and can be communicated to a wide range of audiences.


The OHI framework is standardized yet tailorable to different contexts and spatial scales. This is possible because the core framework of how goals are scored does not change while the goal models themselves are developed with local information and local decisions specific to the context.

Assessments using the OHI framework are facilitated by the OHI Toolbox that is used to calculate and visualize scores. The OHI Toolbox is a suite of collaborative, open-source tools and instruction that provides structure for data organization and storage, data processing and goal modeling. Like the framework, the Toolbox has two parts: the core engine behind calculating and visualizing scores, which is an R package called ohicore, and a tailored repository to organize, store, and share information and write goal model equations specific to the local context.

The Toolbox enables assessments to be transparent, reproducible through access to detailed methods and computational code, and repeatable with the ability to modify methods and computational code. The results are visualized in a Flower Plot for easy communication with a wide audience - each petal represents one goal and its length is with the score of the goal.
