Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was calculated as the geometric mean of four components, eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris.;Reference point is when the contamination level is zero.;The lack of direct measurements meant that modeled and proxy data were used. The status of this goal was also used in the pressures layers.
Global 2013 - 2015;The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications. Revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region, reported in 2013 USD.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012, with simplifications.
Brazil 2014;The goal model was the same as Global 2012. Data used to model the components for eutrophication (nutrients) and chemicals was the same as in Global 2012, while pathogens and debris were localized to state level data.;The reference point approach was the same as Global 2012.;The study used better, or more local, data than the Global.
U.S. West Coast 2014;The model was the same as Global 2012, with regional instead of global data.;The reference point was set as the number of days when beaches were closed to bathers because pathogen counts were higher than state standards.;The study used more local data than the Global.
Israel 2014;The goal model was the same as Global 2012 with local data.;The reference points for each category of pollutants are government-set standards.;N/A
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach is similar to Global 2012. The same four indicators were used. However, trend data were added as follows: Coastal human population as a proxy for trend in trash. Fertilizer consumption was used as a proxy for trend in nutrient pollution. Trends in access to improved sanitation as a proxy for trend in pathogen pollution. Pesticide consumption as a proxy for trend in chemical pollution.;The reference point is a zero pollution state for each of the components considered.;N/A
China 2015;Status model is similar to global assessments. Pollution is based on nitrogen, phosphate, chemical oxygen demand, and oil pollution.;The same reference point as Global 2012 was used that waters are free from all pollution.;The study used all local data. Data on pathogens and marine debris are poor or unavailable and thus were ignored in the model.
