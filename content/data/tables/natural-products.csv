Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The products used were coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges. Data were from the UN FAO. Each category was weighted by the sustainability of harvest. For the status of each product, we assessed the most recent harvest (in metric tons) per region relative to a fraction of the maximum value (in 2008 USD) ever achieved in that region.;65% of its historic maximum of natural product yield.;Some products of interest had no data available.
Global 2013 - 2015;The goal model had the same approach as Global 2012, with updated data processing.;The reference point was the same as the Global 2012.;The study produced new gapfilling methods. This used estimated US dollar values of harvested products from the tonnage reported, or the tonnage harvested based on a productâ€™s reported economic value.
Brazil 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
U.S. West Coast 2014;This goal was not included in this assessment due to lack of data availability.;N/A;There were too few data available on local-scale harvest, and in the past had occurred mostly in one Californian region. Including this goal in the assessment would have lowered the overall Index score.
Israel 2014;Desalination from sea water was assessed for this goal. The status of this goal is calculated as the ratio of the yield of desalination and a target yield. A Desalination Sustainability was also developed and incorporated.;The target desalination yield set by the Israel Water Authority for year 2020.;The collection and trade in natural resources, such as aquarium fishes and corals are prohibited by law in Israel, but Israel relies heavily on sea water desalination to provide drinking water for over half the households. Therefore, desalination was incorporated into the index for this goal.
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach is the same as the Global assessment. Four natural products were considered: corals, fish oil, ornamental fish and seaweed.;A temporal reference point was used for each natural product: the maximum historical value achieved for each product in each study area.;N/A
China 2015;Status model is the same as in global assessments. Three natural products were assessed: sea salt, chemical products, and bio-pharmaceuticals.;The reference point was the 5-year production average due to large disparities in production among provinces.;The set reference point resulted in high scores since it is easy to achieve a 5-year average.
