Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was calculated as a function of the absolute difference between a region’s total landed biomass from the reference multi-species maximum sustainable yield weighted by a correction factor for taxonomies. This was calculated by summing all the single-species MSY estimates obtained for commercially-landed species.;The reference point was based on the difference from multispecies MSY (mMSY), an estimate of the optimum amount of all marine species that may be caught sustainably. The reference point was set so the total landed biomass of wild-caught species will not be more than 75% of the estimated mMSY using and an asymmetrical buffer where overfished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/BMSY is up to 0.2 points below 1 and under-fished stocks achieve a perfect score if B/BMSY is within 0.5 points of 1.;The approach had to be modified by working with fisheries scientists to adapt the data that were available at the global scale.
Global 2013 - 2015;The status was calculated based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield for each landed stock (B/BMSY) using the catch-MSY model. Single-species values of B/ BMSY were aggregated using a geometric mean.;The reference point was similar to Global 2012 where regions were penalized for under-harvest and more severely for over-harvest.;The catch status was improved in this assessment to capture multi-species effects.The reference point was calculated through a more robust model than the one used in Global 2012, and it is a more direct measure of population health because it relates directly to population size.
Brazil 2014;The status was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012, with a modified sustainability term.;As in Global 2012, the reference point is based on an estimate mMSY.;This was calculated in the same manner as Global 2012 using local-scale data on exploitation category of species caught within Brazil’s EEZ as a catch-based sustainability index.
U.S. West Coast 2014;The status was based on B/BMSY for each landed stock and fishing mortality that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (F/FMSY). There were stock assessments for 41 species with historical data available. Estimates were extracted for each species and then assigned to each region based on the contribution of each species in each region to the overall catch in that region, along with weighting factors.;The reference point was a functional relationship that accounted for fishing pressure. The approach produced lower scores for species where both under-fishing and overfishing are occurring, but did not punish as much for under-fishing of stocks.;This study used formal stock assessments rather than data-poor estimates from catch data. The use of historical information was useful in creating sub-regional scores for this goal. This study also tested the use of a recently published data-poor approach (Costello et al. 2012) to obtain B/ BMSY values for the remaining stocks.
Israel 2014;See Global 2013 assessment.;See Global 2013 assessment.;This study used available data from the past 10 years (10 species and 9 other taxonomy groups). Trend was calculated between 2005 and 2010.
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach is the same as Global 2013-2015.;The same as Global 2013-2015.;Mean catch-per-taxon values come from FAO data updated with local data from Instituto Nacional de Pesca (INP).
China 2015;See Global 2012 assessment.;See Global 2012 assessment.;Data sources were poor for this assessment. Harvest data were reported by each fishing boat, which often fishes across provincial boundaries and outside of the EEZ. Current data thus might not reflect the best regional differences, and may exceed actual harvest levels within the EEZ.
