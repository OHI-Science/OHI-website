Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was calculated by combining the percent of coastal waters that are coastal marine protected areas and the percent of coastline that is protected.;The reference point is 30% protection for both land and sea areas.;It was assumed that it is possible to protect up to 30% of areas.
Global 2013 - 2015;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
Brazil 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;This goal was assessed using a national database of protected areas that included fully-protected and sustainable use designations at federal, state and municipal levels, and included indigenous lands. The highest-scoring area contained the largest continuous extent of protected areas within the country in what is called the Biodiversity Corridor of Amapa´.
U.S. West Coast 2014;The model was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The study used assumptions to define ‘special.’
Israel 2014;Archeological Protected Areas, Beaches of Special Public Interest, and Marine Protected Areas were assessed using the same approach as the Global assessment.;Reference point was set to be areas suggested to be protected by the government.;N/A
Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;This goal focuses on capturing the current value of the percentage of protected coastal areas (1 km onshore) and marine coastal (3 nm offshore) with respect to a fixed reference value.;The same as Global 2012.;Local data comes from Ministerio del Ambiente and Fundacion Natura. All areas considered are within the SNAP.
China 2015;Status model is similar to global assessments.;The reference point is only 5% protection, a target set by national marine protection policies to achieve by 2020.;Only coastal marine protected areas was considered, since protected coastline information is not available.
