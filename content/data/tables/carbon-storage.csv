Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;Seagrasses, tidal marshes and mangroves, were assessed. The whole extent of mangroves was included, including parts on land or in river deltas. The status was measured as a function of its current condition relative to a reference condition and a variable that weights the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon storage.;Reference conditions were set as the current condition or area of coastal plant habitat coverage relative to that in ~1980. Relative contribution was measured as the amount of area each habitat covers relative to the total area covered by all three habitats given available data.;This was not a very ambitious reference point.
Global 2013 - 2015;The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. Mangrove data included 1km inland in addition to 1km offshore.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;There were improvements in data processing.
Brazil 2014;The goal model was the same as in Global 2012. The greatest data gaps were for sea grasses.;Different reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the reference year was 1975, mangroves were 1980, and salt marshes were 1979 - 1981. Estimations were used to retroactively determine the reference condition for mangroves and salt marshes.;The same approach was used as in Global 2012, with local data used as available.
U.S. West Coast 2014;Salt marshes and seagrass beds were considered. Extent was used and habitat health was not used.;Temporal reference points were set for each habitat. For salt marshes, the percentage of pre-industrialized habitat coverage for sand dunes, the habitat extent between the 1950s and 1960s.;The study required reconstructions of historic habitat extents in order to set more ambitious targets.
Israel 2014;This goal was excluded from Israel’s assessment. No data was available on the only carbon-fixing ecosystem found in the Israeli Mediterranean (ie. seagrass), and this region generally has extremely low productivity.;N/A;N/A
Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The modeling approach is the same as Global 2012. But only mangrove was calculated here because of its importance for carbon storage relative to other types of habitats.;Reference point is the existing mangrove coverage for 1991.;Values are measured in units of area (km2).
China 2015;The approach is the same as Global 2012. But China’s model included a new variable, relative carbon sequestration rate of each habitat.;A temporal reference point for each habitat is set to its condition in 1980’s. Time-series data on condition of each habitat was not obtainable. However, rough estimate of relative change in coverage areas since the 1980’s was found in literature.;Relative carbon sequestration rate, together with habitat extent, provide a more complete picture of how habitats contribute to CS than extent alone could do.
