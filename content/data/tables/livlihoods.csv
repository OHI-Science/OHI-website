Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;This was measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs were summed across sectors and wages were averages across sectors within each region.;The reference point for jobs was a temporal comparison using a moving-window value. The reference point for wages was the highest average annual wage observed across all reporting units. A score of 100 indicated that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to the number five years previously, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere.;The goal model assumed there was no-net-loss of jobs in order to account for broader economic trends. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages.
Global 2013 - 2015;The model was similar to Global 2012, with some simplifications.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012 except for a few simplifications in multipliers, wage data, and jobs data. This was done because of data availability and in order to correct for national macroeconomic events across all sectors.
Brazil 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
U.S. West Coast 2014;This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, using local data for the sectors of living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building or repair. Data and sector-specific multipliers came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP).;The reference point was the same as in Global 2012.;This study followed the Global 2012 approach but used local data. It recognized that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region.

Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach is the same as the Global assessment.;A temporal reference points was used for both the number of jobs and salaries. 2009 values were used as the reference point for jobs, and values of 2010 for salaries.;Data for jobs, wages, and unemployment were gap-filled.
China 2015;Status model is the based on the number of direct jobs across marine sectors and the average disposable income among rural and urban inhabitants within a region.;Both jobs and wages have a spatial reference point of the maximum value among all provinces across all years.;Eleven marine sectors are assessed. The number of jobs per sector is not readily available and is extenuated from the nation-wide number of employments for each sector and the total number of marine-related jobs per province. There is not enough information on indirect jobs and is thus left out of the calculation. Due to unavailability of wage information per sector, wage is substituted by disposable income.
