Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was the average extinction risk of iconic species, calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category. An increasing weight was assigned by level of extinction risk of the threat category. A list of region-specific iconic species was combined with a list of globally-recognized iconic species from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species and Flagship Species.;The reference point is to have the risk status as Least Concern.;The lists used were the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species but they only cover a few regions and by no means capture the rich diversity of species that are iconic for local regions.
Global 2013 - 2015;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
Brazil 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
U.S. West Coast 2014;This study replaced the global IUCN risk assessments with regionally-specific species assessments provided by NatureServe.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;Same as Global 2012, with regional data for the threat categories.
Israel 2014;See Global 2012.;The target reference point here is that all species are assessed as “Secure”, giving a goal score of 1.;The IUCN species assessments were used for the calculation of the biodiversity.
Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The same approach as Global 2012 assessment was used.;The reference point was where all Iconic spices are categorized as “least concern”.;Updated with local from IUCN with iconic species of the Golfo de Guayaquil. Three species from the global study were eliminated and 13 new ones were included.
China 2015;Status model is similar to global assessments. However, average extinction risk of all assessed species was only calculated as the weighted sum of the number of species in each threat category, since habitat area per species is not obtainable.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;N/A
