Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status was the demand as estimated by poverty levels. The data were measured by the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, adjusted by the purchasing power parity as a proxy for undocumented trade. The supply was estimated using an indicator that ranked how well regions regulated and supported artisanal fishing, as part of a study by Mora et al. (2009).;The reference point was having supply greater than demand so that unmet demand is 0. This meant that all demand for artisanal fishing was allowed or achieved.;The trend was driven by the change over time in PPPpcGDP as a proxy for demand. This assessment did not incorporate a specific measure of the health of the targeted species or of sustainability of practices.
Global 2013 - 2015;The approach was the same was Global 2012;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;There were no data updates available to change the method.
Brazil 2014;The model was simplified to reflect the primary driver of opportunity as the availability of fish to be captured, as measured by the condition of stocks. This model was based solely on the sustainability index calculated using the exploitation status of species. All species were considered possible targets of artisanal fishing activities.;An established target of 1.0. This meant all stocks are categorized as either Developing or Fully Exploited.;The analysis used national stock status information. It did not include poverty because of the high variation in the country. In addition, it assumes that access to fishing is largely open because permitting and regulations are not restricted.
U.S. West Coast 2014;This study developed a model using three key variables (Physical, Biological, Economical)of physical and economic access to coastal areas, and access to biological resources; Physical: 1 coastal access point per mile. Economic: No change in gas price. Perfect sustainability score on FSI.;This approach did not model demand or have species-specific information. It assumed that as long as there are no obstacles to pursuing artisanal fishing, the goal was fully achieved. These data better capture the nature of small-scale fisheries in the study area than the Global model.
Israel 2014;The goal model is based on a sustainability index calculated using the exploitation status of species. Ten coastal fish species, for which we have data, were considered possible targets of artisanal fishing activities.;An established target of 1.0, when all stocks are categorized as either Developing or Fully Exploited.;The primary driver of artisanal opportunity is the availability of fish to capture (i.e. the condition of the stocks). Access to fishing in Israel is largely open because permits and regulations from the Ministry of Fisheries are not considered restrictive, and in most cases, neither is physical access.
Ecuador - Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;The approach was the same was Global 2012;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;Local information was included for need and sustainability variables.
China 2015;Status model is rewritten and is similar to the 2014 U.S. West Coast assessment. It is based on the three indicators:capacity for exports, the need for artisanal fishing opportunities, and economic capacity;The spatial reference point is the maximum value across all region and all years.; N/A
