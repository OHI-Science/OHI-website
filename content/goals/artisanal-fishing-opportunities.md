### ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. 

Half the worldâ€™s fish harvest is captured by artisanal fishing families.
