### ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES


This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.

----

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural identity and heritage.

> Half the worldâ€™s fish harvest is captured by artisanal fishing families.

This goal measures how easy or hard it is for fishers to access ocean resources when they *need* them and the sustainability of harvest of stocks used by artisanal fishers. The need for artisanal fishing is most directly tied to the percent of population below the poverty line. Access, or ability to meet this need, are institutional permits or encouragements for small fisheries. Sustainability of artisanal fisheries refers to the sustainability of fishing methods and/or the health of targeted species. Sustainable gears are traditional hook and line, as opposed to unsustainable practices such as dynamite and gill net fishing.

A high score indicates that the demand for artisanal fishing is being met using lawful and sustainable methods, or alternatively, there is little economic need for artisanal fishing. A low score indicates that regions are not achieving or allowing sustainable artisanal fishing opportunities to be realized.

While small-scale fishing provides benefits and opportunities for local communities, limited or ineffective regulation and enforcement can signficantly impact the ability to pursue it.
