### ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of seafood, whether it is helping meet the basic nutritional needs of over half of the worldâ€™s population to high-end sushi. This goal, then, **measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested in a given EEZ or region through any means for use primarily in human consumption or export** and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries.

The Food Provision goals aim to maximize the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks; any unsustainable extractive practices is penalized, and so is over- or under- harvesting.

Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.

> It would be ideal to include catch and effort information for commercially, recreationally, and artisanally fished species in your area, although most completed assessments have only been able to include catch information from commercial fisheries due to data availability limitations. When data become available for artisanal and/or recreational catch, they could be included as part of the fisheries sub-goal or as a separate sub-goal depending on the context.

> The sub-goals of Food Provision (Fisheries and Mariculture) measure the amount of goods sustainably harvested from the sea for human consumption, while the Natural Products goal measures the amounts of non-food goods for trade (eg. coral, fish for aquarium, etc) in your study area. Data for both goals are often recorded in the same sources. It may be time-saving for the goal keepers for these two goals to join efforts to gather data.

#### General Approach

Ideally, you would have information about the quantity of species caught or harvested (tonnes), the effort involved (particularly important for the Fisheries sub-goal), the practices used (fishing gear, mariculture inputs, extraction methods), and the spatial extent where the practices occur (fishing locations, mariculture farms). Regarding the species caught or harvested in your area, in Global Assessments, information by species for fisheries and mariculture are processed separately before being combined to calculate status scores.

Goal models should also incorporate a indicator of the sustainability of each practice. In the case of Fisheries sub-goal, Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is used as a benchmark, calculated from available harvest (and efforts) information.

For Mariculture, Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) is used in the model. In the global assessment, MSI is calculated based on three sub-indices that directly measured long-term renewability of a given mariculture practice: the wastewater treatment index, the origin of feed index (i.e. fishmeal or other) and the origin of seed (i.e. hatchery or wild caught).

The overall Food Provision model should not change; it is a combination of fisheries and mariculture scores, with the contribution of each type of practice to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different assumptions and apportion weighting differently.

**Pressures and Resilience** measures must be considered as well. What pressures act on the harvesting of these species? If information allows, pressures and resilience measures can act on different species, group of species, or practices separately, as is done with Natural Products. Fishing or harvesting practices can also act as pressures for other goals, for example destructive fishing practices can impact habitat-based goals and genetic escapes from mariculture practices can affect Fisheries and Biodiversity.
