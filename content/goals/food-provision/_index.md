### HARVESTING SEAFOOD SUSTAINABLY
This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught or farmed marine foods.

----

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of food, whether it is helping meet the basic nutritional needs of over half of the worldâ€™s population or providing high-end sushi. 

This goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes mariculture, and wild-caught commercial, artisanal, and recreational fisheries. 

A high score indicates that a region has maximized the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks. For Fisheries, both over- and under- harvesting are penalized. For mariculture, production should meet its sustainable "potential".  The potential harvest may be based on what biologically possible given the conditions and amount of area available to mariculture, or alternatively, established targets of production that have been established within the region.

This goal is the combination of two subgoals: Fisheries and Mariculture. For the Global Assessment, the contribution of these two subgoals to the overall score is weighted by their relative contribution to the total seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different assumptions and apportion weighting differently.
