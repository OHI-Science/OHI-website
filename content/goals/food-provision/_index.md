### HARVESTING SEAFOOD SUSTAINABLY

One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides people is the provision of food, whether it is helping meet the basic nutritional needs of over half of the world’s population or providing high-end sushi. This goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested or grown for human consumption, including wild-caught commercial fisheries and mariculture.

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

Global food provision scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

Food Provision is the production weighted average of two subgoals: Wild-caught commercial seafood and Mariculture, or ocean-farmed seafood. The more seafood harvested or cultured sustainably, the higher the goal score. 

The wild-caught commercial seafood subgoal evaluates success in obtaining maximal wild harvests without damaging the ocean’s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. Sustainable harvest of wild-caught seafood avoids excessively high exploitation of target species and does not target threatened populations. Fishing pressures resulting in habitat destruction and high bycatch may reduce the resilience of the ecosystem, fisheries productivity, and benefits from other goals. 

Sustainable mariculture supports food provisioning needs in ways that can be maintained over the long term. This includes not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. Mariculture that degrades or destroys habitats or allows accidental release of non-native species creates pressures that reduce benefits from other goals.
