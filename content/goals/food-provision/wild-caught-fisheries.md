### AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL FOOD SOURCE
This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught fisheries.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION
One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides is the provision of seafood. One in 7 people rely on fish as a daily source of protein, yet global catches have been declining steadily since peak catch in 1996 (Pauly and Zeller 2016). Given pressures on fisheries and projected increases in human population, it may become difficult to rely on wild-caught marine fish to meet basic nutritional needs. Accurate assessment of fisheries is crucial to avoid overfishing which can threaten human food supplies and the social and economic sustainability of fishing communities worldwide. 


The wild-caught commercial seafood subgoal evaluates success in obtaining maximal wild harvests without damaging the oceanâ€™s ability to continue providing fish for people in the future. Sustainable harvest of wild-caught seafood avoids excessively high exploitation of target species and does not target threatened populations. Each year's catch must not take so much from the population that future catches will decline.

The status of a fishery is usually measured by the current abundance of a stock(s), expressed as biomass of fish in the water, in comparison to a reference point.  For example, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) categorizes stocks as 'overexploited', 'fully exploited' or 'underexploited' depending on whether the current biomass is less than 40 percent, 40-60 percent, or greater than 60 percent, respectively of the 'pristine' (unfished) biomass (Ye 2011). 

The Ocean Health Index uses estimates of biomass to assess stock status, with the reference point that the biomass of all stocks should be at the level that provides maximum sustainable yield. 

Stock status can also be judged by spawning potential, catch trend and size-age composition. Spawning potential is measured as the ratio of the total biomass of sexually mature fish in the stock  ('spawning stock biomass') to the number of fish large enough to be caught that 'recruit' to the population each year through growth or migration. Ratios of less than 20 percent, 20-40 percent and greater than 40 percent indicate stocks that are 'overexploited', 'fully exploited' and 'non-fully exploited', respectively. Catches that drop significantly without reduction of fishing effort or that are less than 50 percent of the maximum indicate an overexploited stock, as does an unstable size-age composition. Catches that remain at or close to peak values for the past 5-10 years and/or have stable size-age composition indicate a fully exploited stock. Catches that  increase with increased effort without any change in size-age composition are non-fully exploited (Ye 2011).

FISHBASE
Developed at the WorldFish Center in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and many other partners, this global information system provides detailed information on almost all of the known world fish species and aquatic living organisms (marine and freshwater), and is searchable by country and species.

THE SEA AROUND US PROJECT 
The Sea Around Us project investigates the impact of fisheries on the marine ecosystems of the world, and offers mitigating solutions to a range of stakeholders. The project is a scientific collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the Pew Environment Group that began in July 1999. The Sea Around Us  project conducts a catch reconstruction program, the results of which improve the accuracy of estimates of catch, stock exploitation status, and other key factors for fisheries management.
