### AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD
This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize the production of farm-raised marine food.

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

The current score indicates that most regions are not sustainably producing the amounts of farmed fish and seafood that they potentially could.  A small number of countries are responsible for almost all global mariculture production.

Global mariculture scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION
As humanity’s population continues to expand, we must increasingly rely upon new and improved methods for cultivating food on land and in the ocean. The term aquaculture refers to the cultivation in water (fresh and saltwater) of animals or plants for human consumption. Mariculture refers to the commercial harvest of seafood that is farm-raised in the ocean and along the coast.

Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production sector in the world! As the population contines to grow, it will become increasingly important to efficiently grow food using sustainable mariculture practices.

The mariculture goal score is based on the quantity of food obtained from mariculture relative to the potential amount it could produce given the availability of suitable habitat. The harvest quantity for each species is adjusted for the sustainability of the farming practices where it is grown.

This approach does not penalize regions that have less geographic area conducive to mariculture, but it assumes that the coastal areas have necessary social inputs for labor, coastal access, infrastructure and economic demand. 

High scores mean that a country is sustainably rearing as much farmed fish and seafood as possible based on its own potential. A low score can indicate one of two things – that seafood is being farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing their potential to farm marine animals or seaweed in their coastal territory.
