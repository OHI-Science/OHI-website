### AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD
As humanity’s population continues to expand, we must increasingly rely upon new and improved methods for cultivating food on land and in the ocean. The term aquaculture refers to the cultivation in water (fresh and saltwater) of animals or plants for human consumption. Mariculture refers to the commercial harvest of seafood that is farm-raised in the ocean and along the coast.

Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production sector in the world! As the population contines to grow, it will become increasingly important to grow food using sustainable mariculture practices.

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

The current score indicates that most regions are not sustainably producing the amounts of farmed fish and seafood that they potentially could.  A small number of countries are responsible for almost all global mariculture production.


### TRENDS
Global fisheries scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION
The mariculture goal score is based on the total harvest of food obtained from mariculture relative to the potential harvest a country is capable of producing given the availability of habitat suitable for mariculture. The harvest tonnes is adjusted by the sustainability of the farming practices of each country for each species.

This method does not penalize regions with less geographic area conducive to mariculture, but it assumes that the coastal areas have necessary social inputs for labor, coastal access, infrastructure and economic demand. 

High scores mean that a country is sustainably harvesting as close to the maximum amount of farmed fish and seafood as possible based on its own potential. A low score can indicate one of two things – that seafood is being farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing their potential to farm marine animals or seaweed in their coastal territory.
