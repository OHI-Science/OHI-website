### PRESERVING MARINE SPECIES

This goal measures the conservation status of marine species. 

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

The current score indicates that many marine species are at risk and there is the potential risk of losing a significant proportion of marine species diversity.



Global species scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

The species that inhabit the ocean have a vital role in shaping the existing marine environment.  They are valued for their beauty and inherent right to exist, as well as their role in supporting productive habitats that provide many benefits for people.

From the largest predators to microscopic plankton, these species depend upon each other for survival. The interaction of species that have naturally evolved in a given location is essential for ecosystem structure and stability.  In additon, the maintenance of large numbers of species provides diverse genetic resource that makes it possible to avoid functional collapsie, should conditions change in the future. 

This sub-goal assesses the health of all marine species present in a country's EEZ, including endangered species and species in relatively good conditions. The presence of species that are not at risk leads to a higher score.
