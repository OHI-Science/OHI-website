The Food Provision goal measures the amount of seafood sustainably harvested through any means for use primarily in human consumption and thus includes wild-caught commercial fisheries, mariculture, artisanal-scale and recreational fisheries. 

A high score indicates that a region has maximized the amount of sustainably produced seafood from wild or ocean-cultured stocks. For Fisheries,any unsustainable extractive practices is penalized, and so is over- or under- harvesting. For mariculture, production should meet it's sustainable "potential".  The potential harvest may be based on what biologically possible given the conditions and amount of area available to mariculture, or alternatively, established targets of production that have been established within the region.

Because we do not track where the fish go after being caught or produced, this goal does not aim to measure food security for the population of a given country, but instead measures the food provided from its waters.


>The sub-goals of Food Provision (Fisheries and Mariculture) measure the amount of goods sustainably harvested from the sea for human consumption, while the Natural Products goal measures the amounts of non-food goods for trade (eg. coral, fish for aquarium, etc) in your study area. Data for both goals are often recorded in the same sources. It may be time-saving for the goal keepers for these two goals to join efforts to gather data.

#### Practical Guidance

This goal is the combination of two subgoals: Fisheries and Mariculture. For the Global Assessment, the contribution of these two subgoals to the overall score is weighted by their relative contribution to the total seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different assumptions and apportion weighting differently.
