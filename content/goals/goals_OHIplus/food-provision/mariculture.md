The Mariculture subgoal measures the ability to maximize the amount of seafood from farm-raised facilities without compromising the ocean’s ability to sustainably provide food now and in the future.  

A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably growing the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own potential (where its maximum potential is estimated in different ways depending on the assessment). 

#### Practical Guidance

*_STEP 1: Mariculture Data_*
This goal requires two key pieces of information: the amount of mariculture food production according to region and taxa, and a corresponding measure of how sustainably it is produced.

Ideally maps will be available that describe the location and tonnes of production for each mariculture taxa.  If maps are not available, then tables summarizing production by region will be sufficient. The FAO (http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-aquaculture-production/en) provides the tonnes (and USD) of taxa-specific production by country, but for subcountry analyses, it will be necessary to  distribute the production among the regions.

> Fish that are used as feed for other fish (e.g., sprat) would be more appropriate to include in Natural Products. This is because they are not being consumed directly. Fish such as sprat, for example, may be used to feed pigs in addition to other fish, and therefore you would need to know how much (tonnage) is being produced, and where it is going to be able to accurately distinguish these categories to avoid double-counting.

> Currently, most mariculture seaweeds are produced for human consumption and, if possible, should be included in the Mariculture subgaol.

For each category of mariculture, a score describing the sustainability of the rearing practices is required.  This can take into account many variables, including: monitoring and tracking programs to ensure quality and safety for human consumption; sustainable sources of seed stocks; sustainably produced feed; minimal habitat destruction; maintainance of clean waters; rearing practices that do not promote disease or introduction of invasive species.  

Sustainability scores should be as specific as possible, for example describing the sustainability for a specific taxa, region, rearing practice, etc.  But data at this resolution is usually not available.  The sustainability data used by the Global Assessment is from the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendations/search?query=).  This is a valuable source of data and relatively detailed, but even so, we must do a fair amount of gapfilling to ensure every taxa and country gets a sustainability score.

*_STEP 2: Determine the Reference Point_*

There are various approaches for determining the reference point for this goal depending on available data and regional goals. 

One option is for the reference point to be based on the maximum potential yield of mariculture in each region.  One factor limiting potential yield is the availablity of suitable habitat for mariculture of each cultured taxa. Obtaining this value requires estimating the amount of harvest that is possible in a region given the available area and biological conditions (e.g., temperature and nutrient levels can support mariculture). A valuable reference that explores mariculture production potential at the global scale is Gentry et al. 2017.  We used this general approach to determine aquaculture production potential for each country.    

However, reference points based entirely on habitat suitability models will overestimate potential production for several reasons.  Models generally fail to capture all the biological and geomorphological limitations to production. In addition to biological constraints to mariculture production, there could be economic or social constraints that should also be considered.  Mariculture will compete for space with many other ocean uses, including fishing, tourism, shipping, and other activities. Regions may also limit mariculture in high biodiversity or environmentally sensitive areas. In addition to habitat suitability for each cultured species, estimates of production  potential for mariculture should also incorporate economic and social  variables. These include distance from the coast and/or human population centers, demand for seafood, and allotment of marine space to mariculture versus sports, hotels, beaches, tourism, or other uses. 

Consequently, it will be necessary to consider these factors in determining production potential.

 
For the Global Assessment, we adjusted the habitat suitability estimates of production potential to account for the social and economic realities as well.  In this case, we constrained the per-country potential to 1% of the potential tonnage estimate and used these country values as reference points. However, this could be fine-tuned at a local level by finding maps describing where coastal activities are allowed or restrictions to useage. Or, information about local preferences for mariculture seafood versus other activities and uses could help adjust the reference point.

This approach would not penalize regions that have less geographic area available for mariculture, though places with fewer sheltered bays or lower primary production could be at a disadvantage.

**The reference point** will depend on your context. You should try to account for the full potential extent of mariculture in your marine areas. Keep in mind that in the Global approach, a low score can indicate one of two things – that species are being farmed in an unsustainable manner or that regions are not maximizing the potential to farm in their marine territorial waters.

It is important to think about the meaning of your reference point. The spatial reference point in the Global approach assumes that because one country is able to produce such a high proportion of mariculture to its coastal area, all regions should be able to as well, given current ecological and technological conditions. This also assumes that it is socially desirable for all regions to produce farmed species at this level, which is likely not true for all regions. The Global approach compared observed production density of all areas to the highest observed production density after the sustainability coefficient was applied.
