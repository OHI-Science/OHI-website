People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, this goal assesses the conservation status of species.

Ideally this goal directly assess the condition of all marine species living in an area.  However, because only a small proportion of marine species worldwide have been mapped and assessed, this goal may be improved by also evaluating the condition of habitats that support many species. In this context, condition of the habitat is a proxy for the broad suite of species that depend on them. 

A score of 100 means all species are at very low risk of extinction and all habitats are conserved.
