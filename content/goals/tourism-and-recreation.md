### THE DRAW OF THE OCEAN
Coastal and marine tourism is a vital part of a country’s economy. This goal measures participation in sustainable tourism to coastal regions. 

----

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Tourism and recreation in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems. Tourism and recreation provide opportunities for the enjoyment of marine and coastal environments.  The ability to visit culturally or aesthetically pleasing places with healthy coastal ecosystems, diverse wildlife, and opportunities for exploration and recreation contributes to the well-being of many people. 

Because coastal tourism is one of the fastest growing sectors of tourism and recreation and a major economic driver for many nations, it is important for coastal destinations to maintain or improve their appeal to travelers.

The Tourism & Recreation goal measures how successfully a region’s marine and coastal areas maintain their attractiveness as destinations for people to experience and enjoy priced activities, such as paid boat excursions, visits to coastal parks with entrance fees and ocean-view hotels, as well as unpriced activities such as free days at the beach and hikes on public trails.  

A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.
