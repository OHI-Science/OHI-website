description: "This sub-goal assesses the health of all marine species present in a region, including endangered species and species in relatively good conditions. The presence of higher-risk species leads to a higher score."

### Protecting culturally significant species

The iconic species subgoal measures the conservation status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

A high score indicates that few to none of the iconic species in a country’s EEZ have been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered, threatended, vulnerable, or at risk of extinction. A low score indicates that many are in those categories.

The current score indicates that iconic marine species are not as well protected as possible in many places. Substantial conservation efforts will be required in order to improve the status of many iconic species that call the ocean home.


Iconic species scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales).

Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). 

Some of the most widely recongnized iconic species are threatened or endangered.

[QUESTION: Can we recreate the images/information for the specific iconic species located here (Green turtle, humpback whale...): http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/sense-of-place/iconic-species]
