### Protecting culturally significant species

The iconic species subgoal measures the conservation status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.

----

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a speciesâ€™ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales).

Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). 

Some of the most widely recongnized iconic species are threatened or endangered.

[QUESTION: Can we recreate the images/information for the specific iconic species located here (Green turtle, humpback whale...): http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/sense-of-place/iconic-species]
