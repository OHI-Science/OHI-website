Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.

> Data for this goal will likely have considerable overlap with Biodiversity sub-goal: Species. It will be effective for the goal keepers of Biodiversity and Sense of Place to share the data searching efforts.

### Ideal Approach

Ideally, you would have a list of species that are valued as iconic and information on their habitat ranges along with scientific studies that speak to the health of their populations. A reference point is where all iconic species are at a healthy level of existence.

### Practical Guidance

First you need to identify the Iconic Species. In practice, Iconic Species are usually a subset of the broader list of species in an area, and so you should be able to find Iconic Species after having found assessed species data for the Species sub-goal of the Biodiversity goal. (See Biodiversity for more detailed instructions.) Once you have the full list of assessed species, you can determine a subset for Iconic Species. For instance, are there known “indicator species” in your area? Are there species that are culturally held as valuable? Do any species appear on the currency or postage stamps?

> Since different species are be iconic to different groups, defining which species are iconic can be challenging when it’s a cultural question. You might have to find information from experts on local customs and tradition.

The choice of inclusion of iconic species in your list can be subjective. You could also come up with specific inclusion criteria, for instance, that would filter a list of species or filter a subset of the gathered data for Biodiversity. This would be a more rigorous approach because then it could be documented and you could replicate the study in future assessments.

Ultimately, almost any species can be iconic to someone, and so the intent with this goal was to focus on those species widely seen as iconic within a country, and iconic from a cultural or existence value (rather than for a livelihoods or extractive reason). Many lists exist for globally important, threatened, endemic, etc. species, but in all cases it is not clear if or to what extent these species represent culturally iconic species. In the global assessment, species were drawn from the World Wildlife Fund’s global and regional lists for Priority Species (especially important to people for their health, livelihoods, and/or culture) and Flagship Species (‘charismatic’ and/or well-known). These lists are note the only source that included cultural reasons for listing iconic species and you should try to acquire more information on locally relevant species.

After identifying the list of iconic species, you need to find a matrix to reflect the health of their population. In the global study, we used IUCN threat categories and weights. The reference point is to have the risk status of all assessed species as Least Concern. Alternatively, you can use a different kind of assessment approach to see if the populations are healthy, which could be indicated, for instance, by the stability of their populations.
