### IDENTIFYING AND PROTECTING THE AREAS WE CARE ABOUT
The Lasting Special Places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity. 

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

A score of 100 means that a country is protecting at least 30% of their coastal areas (3nm offshore and 1km inland).  Currently, many countries are acheiving this goal, but there is more progress to be made.


[Explore country trends from past 10 years. Showing a histogram with trend for each country for this goal.]

Global lasting special places scores have increased by ??? points per year since 2012. Which shows the remarkable effectiveness of programs encouraging conservation.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Special places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons.  Designating a place to be a landmarke, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.

Well-maintained and protected lasting special places provide culturally significant resources that can generate economic opportunities and help to sustain coastal communities.
