### IDENTIFYING AND PROTECTING THE AREAS WE CARE ABOUT
The Lasting Special Places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity. 


----

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

Special places are coastal and marine areas that are culturally significant for a variety of reasons.  Designating a place to be a landmarke, monument, and/or Marine Protected Area can help ensure its existence, provide valuable ecosystem services and preserve cultural heritage and identity.

Well-maintained and protected lasting special places provide culturally significant resources that can generate economic opportunities and help to sustain coastal communities.
