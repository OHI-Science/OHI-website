### Harvesting Food Products
In many countries the harvest of non-food natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an important component of a healthy ocean. This goal assesses the ability of countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, such as corals, shells, seaweeds, and fish for the aquarium trade.

It does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable.

> Similar to Food Provisions, this goal is trying to capture the value of goods sustainably harvested by the ocean. While Food Provision focuses on goods for human consumption, Natural Products assesses non-food goods. As these two goals often share similar data sources, it may be time-saving for the goal keepers of these two goals to work together and gather data.

### General Approach

Ideally, you would have information about the quantity of species caught or harvested (tonnes), the effort involved (particularly important for the Fisheries sub-goal), the practices used (fishing gear, mariculture inputs, extraction methods), and the spatial extent where the practices occur (fishing locations, mariculture farms). Regarding the species caught or harvested in your area, in Global Assessments, information by species for fisheries and mariculture are processed separately before being combined to calculate status scores.

Goal models should also incorporate a indicator of the sustainability of each practice. In the case of Fisheries sub-goal, Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is used as a benchmark, calculated from available harvest (and efforts) information.

For Mariculture, Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) is used in the model. In the global assessment, MSI is calculated based on three sub-indices that directly measured long-term renewability of a given mariculture practice: the wastewater treatment index, the origin of feed index (i.e. fishmeal or other) and the origin of seed (i.e. hatchery or wild caught).

The overall Food Provision model should not change; it is a combination of fisheries and mariculture scores, with the contribution of each type of practice to the overall score is weighted by its relative contribution to the total seafood yield. This assumes that one tonne of seafood by any method is the same as any other tonne of seafood. It would be possible to work with different assumptions and apportion weighting differently.

**Pressures and Resilience** measures must be considered as well. What pressures act on the harvesting of these species? If information allows, pressures and resilience measures can act on different species, group of species, or practices separately, as is done with Natural Products. Fishing or harvesting practices can also act as pressures for other goals, for example destructive fishing practices can impact habitat-based goals and genetic escapes from mariculture practices can affect Fisheries and Biodiversity.
