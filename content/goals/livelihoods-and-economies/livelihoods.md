### GOAL DESCRIPTION

People rely on the ocean to provide livelihoods (i.e., jobs with steady wages) and stable economies for coastal communities.  The jobs produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, but also have substantial indirect importance to many others.  

Ideally, this sub-goal describes the quality and quantity as well as the sustainability of marine jobs in a coastal community. The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries directly benefit those who are employed, and also those who gain indirect value from related economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy, such as community identity and tax revenue.
