### AN IMPORTANT GLOBAL FOOD SOURCE
This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize wild-caught fisheries.

### CURRENT SCORE

[Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]

The current score indicates that most regions are significantly below their sustainable target values. Many regions are jeopardizing future catch with overharvesting, while a few are not producing as much wild-caught seafood as they could.


Global fisheries scores have decreased by ??? points per year since 2012.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION
One of the most fundamental services the ocean provides is the


Economies captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors. 

### Ideal Approach

Ideally, revenue data would be collected for all coastal regions, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on the population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set with a moving-window temporal approach.

### Practical Guidance

A number of sectors were not included in the Global Assessments because sufficient data did not exist. However, it might be desirable to include sectors such as ecotourism, sailing, kayaking, surfing, and offshore wind energy production, and scientific research, among others. It may be practical to include the same sectors in the Livelihoods and the Economies subgoals.

> The quantity of Wild-caught fisheries, Mariculture, and participation of Tourism & Recreation are considered separately in specific goals, whereas the monetary component is captured in L&E.

In the global assessment, revenue has a moving-target **temporal reference point** by comparing the value in the current year to values in previous years. Global assessments used a five-year moving-window because it is intended to capture short-term changes in the trajectory. But then you must consider if that amount of time would represent economic trends. If there is a not economic downturn, do you want to reward an increasing number of jobs, or reward maintaining the same number of jobs?

We highly recommend that this remains a temporal comparison so that a specific place is compared to its performance in the past and not to anywhere else.

> You may find resilience metrics that can be used throughout your assessment. There are many economic indices and some might be appropriate for your area. For example, the Global Competitiveness Index was used in global assessments as a resilience for this goal because it means that marine jobs are more likely to be maintained if an area gets a good score on the Competitiveness Index.
