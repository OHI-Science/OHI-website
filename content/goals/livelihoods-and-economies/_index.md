### SUSTAINING JOBS AND THRIVING COASTAL ECONOMIES
This goal measures jobs and revenue from sustainable marine-related industries. Livelihoods and Economies is divided into two sub-goals: Livelihoods, and Economies. Each is measured separately because the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced are both of considerable interest to stakeholders and governments, and can have different patterns in some cases.

### GOAL DESCRIPTION

The jobs and revenue produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, even for those people who do not directly participate in marine-related industries. People value community identity, tax revenue, and indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy. This goal tracks **the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced across as many marine-related industries/sectors as possible** through two sub-goals, Livelihoods and Economies. A score of 100 reflects productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.
