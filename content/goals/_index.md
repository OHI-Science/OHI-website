<!--## Ocean benefits delivered to humans now and in the future.-->


The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean to be one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future. **Ocean benefits delivered to humans are called _goals_ within the OHI framework**, and are widely recognized for supporting human well-being and sustainable ocean ecosystems.

The OHI framework can be used to assess ocean health in many different contexts. The goals included in any OHI assessment will depend on the context such that OHI scores represent the goals that are relevant to the assessment area.

**The OHI framework categorizes goals and sub-goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people**. These goals and sub-goals are listed below, along with the philosophy of the goal and an ‘ideal’ approach to how it would be represented. There is also practical guidance for modelling, and examples from completed assessments, including global and OHI+ assessments.
