<!--## Ocean benefits delivered to humans now and in the future.-->


The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean to be one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future. **Ocean benefits delivered to humans are called _goals_ within the OHI framework**, and are widely recognized for supporting human well-being and sustainable ocean ecosystems.

The 10 goals that comprise the global Ocean Health Index were based on extensive study by scientists, economists and sociologists.  However, the OHI framework is flexible and can be used to assess ocean health in  different contexts, and the goals included in other OHI assessments may differ depending on local context.
