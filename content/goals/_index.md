<!--## Ocean benefits delivered to humans now and in the future.-->


The Ocean Health Index defines a healthy ocean to be one that sustainably delivers a range of benefits to people now and in the future. **Ocean benefits delivered to humans are called _goals_ within the OHI framework**, and are widely recognized for supporting human well-being and sustainable ocean ecosystems.

The 10 goals that comprise the global Ocean Health Index were based on extensive study by scientists, economists and sociologists.  However, the OHI framework can be used to assess ocean health in many different contexts, and the goals included in other OHI assessments may be different depending on the needs of the assessment area. 

We describe the philosophy underlying each goal along with a description of the model used in the global assessment. However, [other assessments](LINK TO OHI+ page) have used different approaches for calculating goal scores either because of data availability or philosophical differences in evaluating goal condition.  Given this we provide additional practical guidance for modelling, and examples from completed assessments.
