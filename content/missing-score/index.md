## Why is my regionâ€™s score missing?

There are a few reasons why a specific region may be missing a global score: 

##### Disputed Territory

Scores for regions where the jurisdictional claim is contested or unclaimed are not estimated under the OHI framework. The assessment uses [exclusive economic zones](http://www.marineregions.org/.) to define region boundaries. More information about the origin of maritime boundaries and their role in the OHI framework can be found [here](/news/maritime-boundaries/). 

##### Landlocked Region

Some regions only border brackish bodies of water that are not consider under the OHI framework. The countries of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan have no score because they only border the Caspian Sea, which is not included in the analysis. 

##### Uninhabitated Region

Uninhabited countries or territories are not included in the OHI analysis. While these do not show up as greyed-out regions on the OHI global scores map, one large coastal region of note that has no score is Antarctica. This continent is considered uninhabited because it has no permanent population. 

##### *Updating Regions*

The Ocean Health Index is always seeking to improve the accuracy of its assessment. If your region of interest is not presently included, please check back in for a future release of the Ocean Health Index.
