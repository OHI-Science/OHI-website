      <description>PRESERVING MARINE HABITATS This goal measures the status of marine habitats that are particularly important in supporting large numbers of marine species.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
The current score indicates that the six habitats assessed- mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, sea ice, and subtidal soft-bottom habitats- are still relatively healthy and intact on a global basis. However, the condition of the assessed habitats has declined over time.</description>
