      <description>This team develops scientific methods, communicates results to governments, marine managers, scientists and the public, manages current operations and directs future development of the Ocean Health Index project. Ben Halpern has been with the project since planning began in 2008. The team gratefully acknowledges the individuals, foundations, organizations and corporations listed as Contributors and Sustaining Partners. This project would not exist without them.

      <description>We are grateful for the generous support from the Pacific Life Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, as well as our founding contributors for helping us build the Ocean Health Index from the beginning. Without their generosity of intellectual and financial support the Ocean Health Index would not be a reality.
The Pacific Life Foundation The Pacific Life Foundation made a commitment in 2011 to become the Founding Presenting Sponsor of the Ocean Health Index.</description>
