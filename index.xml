      <description>ENSURING ACCESS TO ARTISANAL FISHING FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES This goal measures whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so.
 GOAL DESCRIPTION Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. Small-scale fishing is an important component of cultural identity and heritage.</description>

      <description>HARVESTING OCEAN RESOURCES SUSTAINABLY This goal assesses how well countries are maximizing the sustainable harvest of non-food marine resources.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
The current score indicates that many regions have potential to improve sustainable harvests of natural products, either by eliminating overharvesting, increasing harvests that are too low, or reducing the pressures that decrease potential harvests.

      <description>PRESERVING HABITATS THAT ABSORB CARBON This goal captures the ability of coastal habitats to store carbon given the amount of carbon they store and their health.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
The current score indicates that although, in many places, these habitats remain healthy and intact, a significant number have declined significantly since 1980 and more declines are likely in the near future. More protection and restoration must occur if they are to sequester and store the maximum amount of carbon possible.</description>

      <description>THE DRAW OF THE OCEAN Coastal and marine tourism is a vital part of a country’s economy. This goal measures participation in sustainable tourism to coastal regions.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
Low scores for many regions are due to unsafe or unappealing conditions owing to poverty, political turmoil, war or other volatile conditions and scores will likely be depressed until those fundamental conditions improve.</description>

Tue, Dec 01, 2020
2020 Global Ocean Health Index scores now available! We are proud to announce the 2020 Ocean Health Index scores (available here)!
This year marks the ninth global Ocean Health Index (OHI, for short) assessment measuring the sustainable delivery of 10 benefits, or goals, that people want and need from the ocean. The 2020 assessment was led by Gage Clawson, a former OHI Fellow, and Melanie Frazier.</description>

Mon, Sep 21, 2020
A new open data tool for science and management The new assessment tool, the Baltic Health Index (BHI) evaluates comprehensively the health status of the Baltic Sea and has been calculated by researchers at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University, in cooperation with scientists in California who have established the well-known global Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework. The Ocean Health Index provides comprehensive, and quantitative assessments of progress towards healthy and sustainable oceans.</description>

      <description>On Building Transparency and Trust for Healthy New England Seas by Jenny Seifert
Mon, Nov 04, 2019
A case study about transparency in the Ocean Health Index In a world of increasingly complex decision making, transparency has become paramount. This is no exception in science and, specifically, in science-based management of natural resources.
Transparency is at the core of the Ocean Health Index (OHI). As a scientific evaluation of ocean health designed to inform management decisions that affect not just oceans but also people, it comes with the responsibility of transparency.</description>

      <description>Three Lessons for Using the Global Ocean Health Index to Assess Local Oceans by Jenny Seifert
Fri, Apr 26, 2019
Cross-posted at NCEAS
It just made sense. That was a theme I drew from conversations with four people involved in separate efforts to use the Ocean Health Index’s global framework to zoom in on ocean health in their particular regions to support local ocean planning.
The Index was designed to be useful to ocean planning around the world, and to be useful, it must be applicable to place-based management, which is how so many decisions that affect ocean health are made after all.</description>

      <description>We enthusiastically support the use of our data, but please cite our work.
Global OHI assessments require synthesizing data from nearly one hundred sources.
Data are prepared and scores calculated using freely available coding and version control software. In the interest of transparency and the promotion of scientific discovery, we freely provide the data and scripts used to calculate the global Ocean Health Index. However, we do not provide unaltered data obtained from other sources; to obtain these data you must go the original data sources.</description>

      <description>Protecting culturally significant species The iconic species subgoal measures the conservation status of iconic marine species, which are the animals that have unique importance to humans as demonstrated through traditional activities, ethnic or religious practices, existence value, or locally acknowledged aesthetic value.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
A high score indicates that few to none of the iconic species in a country’s EEZ have been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as endangered, threatended, vulnerable, or at risk of extinction.</description>

      <description>IDENTIFYING AND PROTECTING THE AREAS WE CARE ABOUT The Lasting Special Places sub-goal measures how well we are protecting, for current and future generations, the locations that contribute to marine-related cultural identity.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
A score of 100 means that a country is protecting at least 30% of their coastal areas (3nm offshore and 1km inland). Currently, many countries are acheiving this goal, but there is more progress to be made.</description>

      <description>AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD This goal assesses our ability to sustainably maximize the production of farm-raised marine food.
CURRENT SCORE [Put a circle with Global Goal Score, like here: http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/methodology/goals/food-provision]
The current score indicates that most regions are not sustainably producing the amounts of farmed fish and seafood that they potentially could. A small number of countries are responsible for almost all global mariculture production.

      <description>We are grateful for the generous support from the Pacific Life Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, as well as our founding contributors for helping us build the Ocean Health Index from the beginning. Without their generosity of intellectual and financial support the Ocean Health Index would not be a reality.
