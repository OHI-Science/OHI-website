Assessment;Developing the Model;Setting the Reference Point;Other Considerations
Global 2012;The status used the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector at current and reference time points.;In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison. A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous. The years used for GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources.;The study accounted for a regionâ€™s GDP trend. The economic multipliers were used for jobs and revenue but not wages. The study assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers were static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions.
Global 2013 - 2015;The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications: revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region, reported in 2013 USD.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012, with simplifications.
Brazil 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012.;The reference point was the same as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.
U.S. West Coast 2014;The method was the same as Global 2012, but with local sectors represented.;The reference point was calculated in the the same way as Global 2012.;The approach was the same as Global 2012.

Ecuador-Gulf of Guayaquil 2015;Similar to Global 2013-2015. Value added (VA) was added as a measure of local economies, ie. earnings of each sector.;The temporal reference point was the Value Added by each sector in 2007.;Value added was used to replace GDP, which is more appropriate as measure of national economies.
China 2015;Status model is the same as in global assessments.;The spatial reference point is the maximum revenue across all regions over all years.;Data on revenue generated from each marine sector is not available, and thus total revenue from all sectors are used for the assessment.
