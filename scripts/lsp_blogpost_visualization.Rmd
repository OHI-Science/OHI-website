# Steps to create the graph in the LSP Scores blog post by Erika Egg
```{r}
# get library
library(tidyverse)

# set up path and read in scores data
base_path <- "/home/egg/" # change to where your ohi-global repo is
scores <- read_csv(paste0(base_path, "ohi-global/eez/scores.csv")) # scores csv within the ohi-global repo

# get only LSP in the scores dimension, and get global averages by year
lsp_scores <- scores %>%
  filter(goal == "LSP" & dimension == "score") %>% # get LSP sub-goal and score dimension
  group_by(year) %>% # group by year
  summarize(score_avg = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) # take average by year

# create a plot of these averages over time
ggplot(data = lsp_scores, aes(x = year, y = score_avg)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, color = "darkblue") + # make line thicker and dark blue
  theme_minimal() + # clean up theming
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Average LSP Score",
       title = "Global average Lasting Special Place (LSP) scores over time") + # set x, y, title names
  lims(y = c(0, 100)) + # set to range of possible scores to give better idea of increase relative to full range
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # center the title
```
