This goal tries to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. We divided this goal into two sub-goals: Iconic Species and Lasting Special Places, and weighted them equally when combining to create a single goal score. A score of 100 means the species and places important for cultural identity are protected and conserved.
